 1    KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA Nation Religion King  Statement Say Samal Minister of Environment and Head of Cambodian Delegation  High Level Segment of the United Nations Climate Change Conference Warsaw, November 19-22, 2013 ­  - His Excellency Mr. Marcin Korolec, President of CoP19/CMP9, - Distinguished Heads of Delegations, - Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is indeed a great pleasure for me to join you all in addressing the “High Level Segment of the United Nations Climate Change Conference” being held here in the great city of Warsaw, Republic of Poland.  On behalf of the Cambodian Delegation, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the people and Government of Poland for their warmest welcome and gracious hospitality, and for hosting this important event.  May I also take this opportunity to extend our deepest condolences and solidarity to the people and the Government of the Philippines who have been immensely suffering from the devastating effects of Typhoon Haiyan. None of us here have any doubt that climate change is not something of a distant feature. It is affecting us now and constitutes one of the greatest challenges humanity faces in the 21st Century, as the severity and frequency of climate change impacts are going to intensify and amplify. As the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration reaching 400 parts per million for the first time, we are entering a new dangerous zone. Southeast Asia has witnessed an alarming trend of more frequent and intensified floods, droughts and extreme weather conditions over the last decade. These catastrophic disasters, combined with other effects of climate change such as saline intrusion in coastal zones or impacts of pests and disease outbreaks, make climate change a strategic global development issue requiring urgent attention. 
 2 Excellency the President, As a LDC party to the UNFCCC, Cambodia fully supports the collective efforts to address climate change based on key principles of the UNFCCC. Furthermore, my country would like to associate herself with the statements of Nepal on behalf of LDCs and Fiji on behalf of G77+China. - Cambodia calls on all parties that all actions or measures related to climate change must be in full conformity with the principles and provisions of the Convention, in particular those of equity, historical responsibility, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and in ensuring sustainable development of developing countries; - Cambodia recognizes that the increase of temperature will have catastrophic impacts for Least Developed Countries. Annex I Parties must strengthen their political commitments, leadership and willingness to increase the level of GHG mitigation ambition for the pre-2020 period in order for holding the global average temperature below 1.5° C above pre-industrial level by 2100. Particularly, we call upon all parties to understand the sense of urgency to work towards a 2015 agreement, which should incorporate a broad range of commitments by all parties, in particular leadership of all countries to contribute to global climate action as indicated in Article 4.7 of the UNFCCC; - Cambodia urges the implementation of the Adaptation Framework established in Cancun and its provisions for LDCs process to formulate and implement the National Adaptation Plans, as well as the Work Programmes on Loss and Damage based on each country priorities; - Cambodia supports the Kyoto Protocol Second Commitment Period. Furthermore, Cambodia urges all parties to consider the establishment of new mechanisms and approaches under the UNFCCC in order to ensure meaningful emission reductions. We support the implementation of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in developing countries. However, it should be voluntary and based on country priorities and must be supported by developed countries on capacity building, finance and technology transfer; - Cambodia recognises the importance of an agreeable methodology and modalities for implementation of REDD+. In this context, the methodology and modalities should be developed and approved by COP; - Cambodia supports the provision of new, additional and predictable finance from public sources by Annex I countries and it should be accessible directly and easily. The private sector through market-based mechanisms should complement or leverage the public finance.  3 - Cambodia supports the establishment of adaptation mechanism for LDCs in the Green Climate Fund. We urge developed countries to commit and increase their financial supports to countries vulnerable to climate change especially the LDCs; - Cambodia calls for a comprehensive finance roadmap to provide new, additional and predictable public finance to developing countries to fill the gaps between 2013-2020;  - Cambodia encourages developed countries to provide financial supports of US$100 billion annually to developing countries by 2020 as indicated in the Copenhagen Accord; - Cambodia supports enhanced actions to improve capacities and capabilities of developing countries. The capacity building should be a continuous process, country-driven, fully participatory and an integral process;  Excellency the President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Cambodia is vulnerable to impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Floods and droughts have already ravaged parts of our country with recurring frequency and greater severity. Within our limited resources and capacity, we have done our utmost to respond to the challenges caused by climate change and to contribute to global efforts to address climate change issues through building our institutional capacity, formulating and implementing policies, mainstreaming climate change into national planning and budgetary processes, and implementing actual measures to build community resilience and sustainable livelihoods. Just a week ago, we conducted our 3rd National Forum on Climate Change during which the Royal Government has launched the first-ever Climate Change Strategic Plan that sets out priorities for future actions to address climate change.  I wish to reiterate our commitment to work with all partners to address climate change. We cannot afford to ignore climate change since the cost of ignoring it will far exceed the cost of taking actions now. We strongly believe that addressing climate change is the only way to ensure our survival and prosperity. And we believe that we can turn the climate change crisis into a new opportunity for a greener, low-carbon, resilient, equitable, sustainable and knowledge-based development. I wish the conference in Warsaw a great success.  Thank you for your kind attention!
