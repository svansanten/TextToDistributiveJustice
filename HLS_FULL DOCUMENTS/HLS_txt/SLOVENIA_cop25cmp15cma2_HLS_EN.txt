Allow me to express my gratitude to the Government of Chile for their dedicated work
to ensure a successful COP25. I would also like to thank the Government of Spain for
offering their support to the Chilean Presidency. We greatly appreciate the decision of
Spain to step up to the plate and make sure that the COP25 meeting takes place today.
Climate change, as we all know, is one of the most pressing and defining global issues
of our time. As we hear every day it is our generation that has the possibility and
duty to reverse the negative trend of global warming.
Last year, at COP24, most of the Rulebook was successfully adopted. This year’s COP
has to finalise the last elements of the Rulebook in order to make the Paris Agreement
fully operational.
As we are building on the current momentum of the call for more ambitious action, we
must show that this call is heard and understood. Our climate efforts must be in line
with the scientific consensus on limiting global warming to 1.5°C, and that the
scientific community must actively be engaged in this climate action process.
As we update our National Determined Contributions and prepare ambitious long-term
climate strategies on the basis of IPCC reports and this year’s Emissions Gap Report,
let us keep in mind that the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement will
demand joint efforts from us all. No single country can tackle climate change on its
own. Each of us is but a small piece in the grand mosaic that is the Paris agreement.
Slovenia advocates the vision of carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest. With this in
mind, we are in the final stages of the preparation of the new climate law which will
incorporate the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 into our legislation. This will
represent a solid ground for Slovenia’s long-term climate strategy as part of our
transition to a green economy and a more sustainable society.
Slovenia, for example is also an active member of the Green Group consisting of six
small climate-ambitious countries which aim at promoting environmental issues in
international relations. Let me draw your attention to the joint statement of the Green
Group, in which we call for enhanced collective action and ambitious measures, such
as accelerating technology transfer to developing and the least developed countries, in
order to address global warming and climate crisis successfully.
Distinguished delegates,
One of the key issues in terms of meeting the objectives is climate financing.
Developed countries should continue to make progress towards the goal of mobilising
$100 billion by 2020 in the context of achieving Sustainable Development Goals. This
year, Slovenia joined the Climate Finance Initiative and has, for the first time,
contributed to the Green Climate Fund and will continue to do so in the following
years.
We also need to strengthen the inter-connection of climate change mitigation and
adaptation with international development cooperation. In addition, we need to
increase private sector engagement in meeting both our national and global climate
change goals.
In aiming to implement more ambitious climate action we cannot become too
polarised, we must work on even better understanding each other in order to come to
wishful result, that our planet and future generations need.
Thank you!
