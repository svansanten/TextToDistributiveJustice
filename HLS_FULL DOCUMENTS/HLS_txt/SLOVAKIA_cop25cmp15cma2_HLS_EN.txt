Dear Excellences, honourable ladies and gentlemen,
let me thank the governments of Chile and Spain for inviting us here in the splendid city
of Madrid. Your successful cooperation is an example of our strong commitment to
work hard and fast towards our common goal.
We all have gathered here because we are aware of the urgency to accelerate climate
action supported by the recent, clear scientific evidence. If we want to preserve our
planet for the future generations, fundamental and transformative changes are needed in
our key systems. They provide us with necessities such as food, energy and mobility
and at the same time present climate and environmental pressures and health impacts.
We need to move towards a more sustainable and climate-friendly production and
consumption patterns. Slovakia is fully aware of steps that need to be taken and has been
consistently working towards their implementation.
In the last 30 years, Slovakia has undergone radical industrial and social changes. Our
GHG emissions decreased by roughly 40 % since 1990. We have experienced changes
in heavy industry, a large drop in energy consumption, changes in agriculture, expansion
of transport, and development of infrastructure. We have achieved significant fuel
switch from coal and oil to natural gas and renewables, and transformation to less energy
intensive industrial activities. Our electricity generation has become one of the least
carbon-intensive, with almost 80% of electricity generated from carbon free sources.
Recently, Slovakia has made a politically bold decision: to cease subsidies for domestic
coal-fired electricity production by 2023. This will lead to phasing-out of inefficient
coal extraction and transformation of the entire coal-mining region, based on just
transition approach. As a result, the future of this region will go hand-in-hand with smart
and low-carbon innovations.
In addition, we have decided to increase our 2030 reduction targets in EU non-emission
trading sectors from 12% to 20%. At the same time, our Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy targets up to 2030 will be also increased.
We believe that these efforts will help us to join other EU countries in achieving
European climate neutrality by 2050.

To support these ambitions, Slovakia has allocated additional 2.5 billion euros for
climate and environmental investments in the next decade. We are aware of our share
of global responsibility. Therefore, this year for the first time, Slovakia made a
contribution of 2 million US dollars to the Green Climate Fund and plans to continue to
do so in the coming years.
While in the past national climate and energy policies used to be more reactive, now it
is time to move to proactive approach. We are already reflecting this approach in our
strategic planning.
In this context we also underline the importance of Article six of the Paris Agreement.
Proper implementation of this Article would allow countries to reduce emissions in more
cost-effective ways. Article six could become an important pillar for decarbonisation,
and may facilitate investments in technologies with high mitigation potential.
Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have no more time to waste. Strong partnerships from global to local levels, and
across all sectors are essential on the way to a safer and more prosperous world.
Action speaks louder than words. We all need to unite and act in this challenging time
of transformation.
Thank you.
