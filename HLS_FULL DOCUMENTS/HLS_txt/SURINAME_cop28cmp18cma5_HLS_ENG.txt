Mr. Chairman, Disinguished Heads of Government, Secretary General of the United Na.ons,
Esteemed Heads of Delegation, Representa.ves of the UN-FCCC, Ladies and gentlemen, good
day. As we convene at COP28, we must recognize the urgency of our actions to combat the
impacts of global warming and climate change and our responsibility to make the world more
climate-friendly and resilient for future generations. We are deeply concerned about the state
of the climate crisis, referring to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, which states: "The science
is clear: we are on a path to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, which would have
catastrophic consequences for people and planet”. In fact, this very report notes that global
temperatures have risen at an unprecedented rate, with the last decade (2011-2020) likely
being the warmest in over 125,000 years. However, the report also indicates that there is still
time, but only if we take immediate and dras.c measures to limit warming to 1.5 °C.
My country, Suriname, is one of the only three carbon-nega.ve countries in the world. We are
commiZed to keeping it that way! Our country is also highly forested and is currently reported
to have 93% forest coverage. With that comes a high-quality biodiversity, which we must
protect at all costs. Our reported deforestation rate is less than half a tenth of a percent. As
one of the eight Amazonian countries united in the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization
(ACTO) we are committed to fight deforestation by 2030 with the purpose of stopping the
Amazon region from reaching the point of no return.
Together with our partner Amazonian countries we urge developed countries to meet their
obliga.ons to provide and mobilize predictable and adequate support to developing
countries, including development financing, climate financing and biodiversity conservation,
with necessary and commensurate scope, scale and speed, as well as access to technology
and its markets, and capacity building and development, as fundamental measures of
international cooperation, aiming at implementing national policies and programs for the
sustainable development of the Amazon region.
Ladies and gentlemen, we – the People and Government of Suriname - are determined to
maintain this status because it is good for all of us and the world. However, as climate is a
global good, the adverse impacts are felt by all: by the most significant pollution contributors
and idyllic places, such as Suriname in the Caribbean. We, too, like our partners of the
Caribbean Community (CARICOM), are noticing the effects of climate change. We too
experience losses and damages. Even though we house a carbon sink for the absorp.on of
emissions produced elsewhere - at no cost to the polluters – our people are forced to adapt
to extreme dry and wet weather events characterized mainly by droughts and floods. So, we
need to adapt and we need to mitigate proactively.
Suriname has experienced a drought this year that was unknown to us before. The working
and living condi.ons in our country have been altered, with our farmers and Indigenous and
Tribal Peoples (ITPs) being two of the most vulnerable groups affected due to extreme heat
and water scarcity. Currently, rivers are dry or have very low water levels, making it difficult to
transport goods, food, and water to the communities living far in the interior. Adaptation,
especially Adapta.on Finance, will therefore always be a main priority for Suriname. At the
same time, we, a small developing nation in South America with a low-lying coastal area, must
also respond to the legi.mate demands of our population for economic development. We
must provide sound social care systems, s.mulate sustainable economic development, and
project a future with opportunities. Therefore, we leaders must balance these aspira.ons
through developing resilient economies, keeping in mind responsible and sustainable
management of our ecosystems and environment.
Suriname is well aware that our recently announced offshore oil amongst other required
economic developments may raise ques.ons about increases in our carbon footprint. We are
committed and confident that even with these new developments, we will remain carbonnegative! 
We owe it to our nation to make the best use of all our natural resources -our
forests, the biodiversity, and the resources deep down in the earth- equally to benefit our
people and future genera.ons!
Suriname focuses on developing a Low-Carbon Emissions and Resilient Economy Strategy,
taking into account a precau.onary approach to phasing down fossil fuels. Such a balanced
approach is critical to Suriname, given our mandate and commitment to fulfill SDG 7.1 (Access
to Energy) and the common understanding that we will not leave anyone behind. In this
regard, we urge international support in technology transfer and financial support for a just
transi.on to sustainable green energy and transportation options, especially for rural
communities. We are on track to transforming our economy to a low-carbon-genera.onbased
production and consumption system. Nearly fihy percent of our energy generation is
currently from renewable resources. And, as we advance, we strive to do even better in
phasing down fossil energy resources through the reform of our energy supply systems.

And finally, ladies and gentlemen, we must discuss and put into effect climate finance systems
that actually work. New financial pacts must be developed, and pledged financial
commitments must be kept! Global climate funds must become accessible through simplified
procedures to carry out our projects to improve living conditions and not be spent on
consultancies, studies, and nearly impossible-to-aZain administrative procedures.
We must continue our efforts to put the Article 6 Rule Book into practice, further the practical
implementation of mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, capacity building, and "just
transition" finance. We, especially HFLD nations, need incen.ves to conserve our standing
forests and biodiversity. It can never be the case that reforesta.on or silviculture is more
highly valued than preserving our standing forests. Financing removals is thus not only of
utmost importance to na.ons like mine but also in the interest of all of us. The payment for
standing forest should or, better said, must have a much higher value than newly established
silviculture or reforesta.on. Recalling Articles 5 and 6 of the Paris Agreement, REDD+
reductions and removals deserve the financial support that was promised, but still needs to
be delivered. With regard to removals, Suriname underscores the IPCC confirma.on that
Carbon Removals are essential to quickly reduce global emissions. Therefore, as an HFLD
developing country, Suriname highly supports finalizing the Article 6 negotiations on
removals.
Ladies and gentlemen, addressing climate issues requires political will, commitment, in
particular from government and business leaders, and inclusivity of everyone. It requires a
change in mindset. It requires a new and beZer way of organizing our personal lives and
consumption patterns. COP 28 must be a turning point in the fight against climate change. We
must work together to deliver on our commitments based on our Common But Differentiated
Responsibilitoes and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-CR) and to raise our ambition even further.
In closing, let us not forget that there is only one planet, and that planet we inherited will
remain and can continue without us! But we, humans, cannot do without Planet Earth!
I thank you and may God bless you all!
