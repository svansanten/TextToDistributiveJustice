Allow me to convey warm and fraternal greetings from H.E. Dr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, President of the United Republic of Tanzania. Let me thank the Government and People of Morocco for successfully organizing this COP 22 and for the hospitality extended to my delegation since our arrival. We also the UNFCCC Secretariat for the excellent facilities put at our disposal for this Conference.
Mr. President,
We strongly welcome the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and commend all Parties that have ratified the same. Tanzania is in the final process of ratification. This is indeed a historical COP as we are witnessing unprecedented solidarity of the global community in a pace that was never seen before. It would be very remiss of me not to congratulate France for its successful and remarkable Presidency of COP 21. We must now match the speed of ratification to concrete actions toward actual implementation of Paris Agreement.
Mr. President;

The challenges of climate change to my country like in many other African countries are real and cannot be over emphasized. In many cases climate change threatens the very existence and survival of the our farmers, livestock keepers, fishermen, our old men and women, children and youth, our small petty traders, manufacturing and the entire utilities we always depend on for our development. Understanding our vulnerabilities, we have been at the forefront to work together to address this challenge while recognizing the historical perspective, to be able to forge a fair, balanced but differentiated approach.
At the national level, we have been taking ambitious steps to address climate change. Just before the Paris Conference we submitted our Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which reflect our commitment and determination to collaborate with international community in addressing this challenge. Through our INDCs, we intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions economy wide in the context of sustainable development between 10 - 20% by 2030 relative to the business as usual scenario. This is a remarkable contribution in our part taking into account that our per capita emissions are less that 1 tone per capita annually.

As indicated in our INDCs, we expect the needed technological and financial support to the tune of USD 60 billion by 2030 for mitigation and USD 500 million USD annually for adaptation will be availed to be able to meet our contributions and to pursue the development trajectory we want.
With 48.1 million hectares of forested land, we have an estimated total of 9.032 trillion tones of carbon stock, making the country a net carbon sink. We are committed to continuously conserve these biomass assets for the benefit of the country and local communities and at the same time support the global efforts to address mitigation provided the mechanisms that have been put in place ensure that it's the countries and communities that are custodian of these forests that benefit rather than the multinational foreign companies.
We have launched the enhanced national wide tree planting campaign which is poised to increase our sequestration potential. However, a massive mobilization of resources is required to enable us attain this goal and for the sake of implementation of the Paris agreement the resources for implementing this must be provided by the international community.

Mr. President;
Our development plan sets our national priority to explore and use its existing resource to move to a middle income country by 2025. We know it is possible and we are geared toward this vision in all aspects. The challenge we face like many other LDCs is how we can address climate change and remain focused on our agenda. The costs of adaptation and the costs of participating effectively in mitigation need serious international support as agreed in Paris. It is important that here in Marrakesh we unlock the way and means to achieve that. Money seems to be out there but the beaurocratic and procedural processes we are putting in place in all our funds such as the GCF , LDCF, AF and GEF are making it impossible to access these resources in time and at the quantities that can make a paradigm shift in terms of resilience and low emission development pathways. We need to change this. We can not afford a situation whereby the money is there but we are making it impossible to access.
I wish to once again pledge Tanzaniaâ€™s readiness to work with the international community to address the challenges of climate change in in the context of the Paris agreement within the agreed

principles and obligations as we strive to keep the global temperature well below two degrees for our very survival and that of the generations to come.
Your Majesty, Excellencies, Distingished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I thank you for your kind attention.
