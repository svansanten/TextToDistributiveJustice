SALUTATION 
 
MR. PRESIDENT 
 
 EXCELLENCIES 
 
 COLLEAGUES 
 
 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
 
 GOOD MORNING.  
 
 
PERMIT ME TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE AND THANKS TO THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF POLAND FOR THEIR WARM 
WELCOME AND FOR THE COURTESIES EXTENDED TO THE BAHAMIAN 
DELEGATION DURING THIS COP.  
 
WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, 
THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA AND PALAU IN THE WAKE 
OF SUPER TYPHOON HAIYAN. EVENTS LIKE THIS REMIND US OF OUR 
NEED TO LIVE IN HARMONY WITH THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE. THEY 
REAFFIRM THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR ALL NATIONS, 
DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED TO MEET THEIR COMMITMENTS 
UNDER THIS CONVENTION AND THEIR INITIAL COMMITMENTS 
UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR 
BACKS LIDING, BUT A TIME FOR RAMPING UP AND ENHANCING 
COMMITMENT TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASE 
FUNDING TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED EVENTS.  
 
MR. PRESIDENT 
WE ARE A SMALL ARCHIPELAGIC NATION OF 350,000 PEOPLE. THE 
NEED TO REPLICATE AND REPAIR CRI TICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 3 
 THROUGHOUT OUR ISLANDS, IS PARAMOUNT TO MY NATION'S 
ABILITY TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WE MUST 
OPERATIONALISE AND CAPITALISE THE GREEN CLIMATE FUND.... 
NOW! MORE IMPORTANTLY, VULNERABLE STATES LIKE THE 
BAHAMAS MUST BE GIVEN ACCESS TO SUCH FUNDING MECHANISMS. 
PER CAPITA INCOME CANNOT BE THE PRIMARY CRITERIA FOR 
ELIGIBILITY FOR FUNDING, AS IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE REAL 
ECONOMIC AND FISCAL CHALLENGES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. 
THE BAHAMAS NEEDS YOUR HELP!  
 
MR. PRESIDENT 
 WE ARE NOT FULLY ABLE TO ADAPT TO OR MITIGATE THE LOSS 
AND DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED 
PROCESSES. WE ARE LOSING TERRITORY, LIVELIHOOD AND LIVES, 
AND WE CALL UPON THIS COP, TO MAKE A DECISION TO IMPLEMENT 
AN ADEQUATE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS LOSS AND DAMAGE. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT 
 WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO MANAGE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN A 
WAY THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH NATURE. TO THAT END WE HAVE 
TAKEN CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE MEASURES: 
 
1. THE BAHAMAS HAS AMENDED ITS FORESTRY ACT TO PROVIDE 
A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE LONG TERM CO NSERVATION AND 
SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF FORESTS. 
 
 
2. LIMITING THE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES IS BEING 
ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH TAX MEASURES WHICH ENABLE HYBRID 
AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO BE IMPORTED AT A LOWER TARIFF.  
 
IN ADDITION TO THESE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES, WE HAVE 
GIVEN FOCUS TO PROMOTING RENEWABLE ENERGY USE 
WITHIN THE COUNTRY. ALL TA RIFFS ON INVERTERS FOR SOLAR 
PANELS, PANELS AND LED APPLIANCES AND BULBS HAVE BEEN 
ELIMINATED TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE 
AVERAGE BAHAMIAN 
  
 MR. PRESIDENT 
THE GOVERNMENTâ€™S IS FACILITAING CLIMATE ACTION IN THE 
HOUSING SECTOR . WE ARE PURSUING THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN 
SUBDIVISIONS WHICH WILL BE SOLAR POWERED. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT 
 WE NEED ADEQUATE AND PREDICTABLE SOURCES OF FUNDING TO 
MAKE THESE PROJECTS A REALITY. 
 
WE HAVE A NEW ENERGY STRATEGY THAT FOCUSES ON THE 
AWARENESS OF ENERGY CONSERVATION. ALSO, ENERGY 
GENERATION WILL BE 30% POWERED BY RENEWABLE ENERGY 
SOURCES BY 2030 AND IN 2014 THE GOVERNMENT WILL INTRODUCE 
A FRAMEWORK FOR 10% OF THE EXISTING GENERATING CAPACITY 
TO COME FROM SOLAR RESIDENTIAL ENERGY SELF GENERATION. 
THROUGH OUR ENERGY SECTOR REFORMS -OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE 
THE COST OF ELECTRICITY AND OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS BY 
USING CLEANER FUELS LIKE NATURAL GAS.  
 
MR. PRESIDENT 
CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO IMPACT THE BAHAMAS IN A REAL 
AND PRESENT WAY. JUST HOURS AGO, THE COASTLINES OF THE 
BAHAMAS WERE BOMBARDED BY HEAVY SEA SWELLS, CAUS ED BY 
TROPICAL STORM MELISSA. AGAIN, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT 
LOSS AND DAMAGE TO OUR COASTAL INFRASTRUCTURE.  
 
AS THE EVENTUALITY OF SEA LEVEL RISE LOOMS, OUR LOW LYING 
COASTAL MARINE SYSTEM AND GROUND WATER WOULD BE SO 
GREATLY IMPACTED THAT WE COULD LOOSE ALL OUR FARMS AND 
THE FOOD THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE.  
 
MR. PRESIDENT 
THE BAHAMAS IS READY TO WORK. WE HAVE INCREASED OUR 
POLITICAL WILL TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO PROMOTE 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, AS WE WILL NOT ACCEPT A WORLD 
WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED EVENTS LIKE HAIYAN AND 
SANDY ARE THE NORM. 
 
WE WILL NOT ACCEPT A WORLD OF CLIMATE MIGRANTS.  
 
THE TIME IS NOW! THE BAHAMAS WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE WARSAW 
WITH CONCRETE DECISIONS BEING MADE TO ADVANCE OUR 
CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION EFFORTS. 
 
IT IS TIME TO DO MORE, AND IT IS TIME TO DO IT FASTER THAN WE 
HAVE EVER DONE BEFORE. 
 
I THANK YOU.
