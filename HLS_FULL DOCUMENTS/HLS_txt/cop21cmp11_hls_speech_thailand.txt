government highlight major upcoming milestones, especially
in the energy and transport sectors.

5. For energy sector, we focus on the promotion of renewable
energy consumption and the adoption of the Power

emission by saving energy and introducing renewable
energy technology.

6. In the transport sector, Thailand has many ongoing
infrastructure projects on mass transportation system; such
as the ten lines Mass Rapid Transit, the construction of
double track railways and the extension of railway network
into the neighboring countries project.

promotion of voluntary carbon market in the industrial
sector.

Therefore, we aim to increase the forest area nationwide.

meaningful, balanced and comprehensive global climate
