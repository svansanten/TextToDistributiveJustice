      "text/plain": "' \\nThank you, Mr. President . \\n \\nOn beha lf of the government of Japan , I would like to express my sinc ere \\nappr eciation to His Excellency , Minister Marcin Korolec and his \\ngovernment for hosting the COP 19 presidency . \\n \\nI would also like to expr ess my d eepest condolence to the people of the \\nPhilippines and other countries who have been suffering from the r ecent \\ntyphoon. \\n \\nMr. President: \\n \\nA fair and effective framework with the participation of all countries needs \\nto be adopted at COP 21 in 2015 to ensure emissions reduction at the global \\nlevel . \\n \\nIn this regard, Japan firmly supports the establishment of a post-2020 \\nframework . \\n \\nSuch a framework must be based on “nationally -determined” commitment \\nand an effective international transparency mechanism. \\n \\nI will devote myself toward the s uccessful outcome at this COP19 . \\n \\nMr. President: \\n \\nThe Great East Japan Earthquake and n uclear Power Plant’ s Accident in \\nMarch 2011 caused drastic changes in the energy situations . \\n \\nEven under such circumstance both the public and private sectors of Japan \\nhave made utmost efforts to address climate change. \\n \\nOur greenhouse gas emissions for the first commitme nt period is forecasted \\nto be 8.2 percent lower compared to the base year. \\n  \\nAs a result, our target under the Kyoto Protocol of 6 percent reduction has \\nbeen achieved. \\n \\nAs the next step, Japan has set a target to reduce emissions by 3.8 percent \\ncompared to the 2005 level in 2020. \\n \\nThis target may appear to be less ambitious. \\n \\nHowever, this is an ambitious target . \\n \\nIt requires Japan to improve its ener gy efficiency by 20 percent when it is \\nalready at the world’s top level . \\n \\nThis is a target for the time being. \\n \\nIt was determined without taking into account the emissions reduction \\neffect by nuclear power. \\n \\nConsideration is underway on energy policy . \\n \\nWe will conduct further review in line with its progress . \\n \\nAnd then, a firm target will eventually be set . \\n \\nJapan will establish a low carbon society through various policy tools. \\n \\nWe will strategically promote mitigation measures . \\n \\nWe will enhance development and demonstration of renewable \\nenergy -related technologies such as offshore wind power, geothermal power \\nand rechargeable batteries . \\n \\nJapan is hosting the IPCC session next March. \\n \\nUsing that opportunity, we will launch a new public awareness campaign \\nto further encourage low-carbon lifestyles. \\n \\nMr. President: \\n \\nJapan reaffirms the goal to reduce emissions by 50 percent at the global \\nlevel and by 80 percent in the developed world by 2050.  \\n\\nNow is the time for Japan to take “ Actions for a Cool Earth” as advocated \\nby Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \\n \\nFirst, Japan will promote further technological innovation . \\n \\nIn this context, Japan’s public and private sectors plan to invest a total of \\n110 billion US dollars domestically over the next five years. \\n \\nSecond, Japan will promote the application of Japanese low-carbon \\ntechnologies around the world. In so doing , we will contribute to global \\nemission s reductions through the use of the Joint Crediting Mechanism, or \\nJCM . \\n \\nFurthermore, Japan will strengthen its partner ships with countries and \\nstakeholders. \\n \\nWe will provide support to developing countries totaling 1.6 trillion yen, \\nabout 16 billion US dollars, during the 3-year period from 201 3 to 201 5. \\n \\nWe will mobiliz e official development assistance, other official flows, and \\nprivate finance in the field of mitigation and adaptation. \\n \\nTokyo has been selected as the host of the 2020 Summer Olympics and \\nParalympics. \\n \\nThrough the Olympic Games , we will demonstrate to the world a society \\nwith low carbon foot print, a society in harmony with nature and a society \\nbased on sound material cycle. \\n \\nThank you for your kind attention.
