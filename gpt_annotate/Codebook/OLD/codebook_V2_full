You are presented with speeches presented at the UNFCCC COP High Level Segment. Evaluate all sentences for ALL 37 elements:

1.	relevance_0: Binary label indicating relevance. 1 if the sentence presents a descriptive or factual statement, 0 otherwise. Examples are found in descriptions of policies that are already implemented in a country. All statements expressing gratitude, other formalities, or rhetoric questions are also deemed not relevant.
2.	relevance_1: Binary label indicating relevance. 1 if the normativity of the sentence is ambiguous, 0 otherwise. These sentences refer to policy intentions (“we will do X”) or expectations that are not supported by any normative motivations but do prescribe an action or behaviour.
3.	relevance_2: Binary label indicating relevance. 1 if the sentence presents a normative statement with a value judgment or prescription based on norms and values, 0 otherwise. A complete normative statement also includes a motivation for the claim that is made, or this motivation can be derived from textual context. An example is found in “X should be done because Y”. Statements that prescribe normative elements that should be considered in new policies are also seen as relevant.

Label the principle that is foundational in the expression of normative judgement or prescriptions based on moral values. It can be seen as the motivation where a statement is based on. Example: Prescribing the need to take action, motivated by the need to improve the lives of all, would be labelled as utilitarian.
4.	principle_0: Binary label indicating the principle applied. 1 if relevance_2 is 0: no specific principle can be applied, 0 otherwise.
5.	principle_1: Binary label indicating the principle applied. 1 if relevance_2 is 1 but it's unclear which principle is used, 0 otherwise.
6.	principle_2: Binary label indicating the principle applied. 1 if relevance_2 is 1 and presents an egalitarian motivation. Motivated by the goal to reduce inequalities and have equality of opportunity. This includes statements the highlight the inclusion of all and references to mutual contributions by all. 0 otherwise.
7.	principle_3: Binary label indicating the principle applied. 1 if relevance_2 is 1 and presents a utilitarian motivation. Motivated by the goal of maximizing the benefit of all or contributing to ‘the greater good’. The benefit of all can be in present and future generations. 0 otherwise.
8.	principle_4: Binary label indicating the principle applied. 1 if relevance_2 is 1 and presents a prioritarian motivation. Motivated by the moral obligation to help the worst off. Highlighted in sentences focussing on supporting vulnerable developing countries. It does not focus existing differences.  0 otherwise.
9.	principle_5: Binary label indicating the principle applied. 1 if relevance_2 is 1 and presents a sufficientarian motivation. Motivated by the idea that everyone should be able to reach a common level of well-being. Found in sentences referring to a global standard of well-being that everyone should reach as well as statements implying that no one should be left behind this threshold. 0 otherwise.
10.	principle_6: Binary label indicating the principle applied. 1 if relevance_2 is 1 and presents a libertarian motivation. Motivated by a need for freedom, indicating minimal government involvement and focus on free markets. Otherwise label as 0.

topic_0 to topic_9: Binary label indicating the topic discussed. Label as 1 if applicable, label as 0 if not applicable. Each topic represents a specific focus of the sentence, and only one topic can be selected per sentence.

12.	topic_1: Requirements for new UNFCCC policy.
13.	topic_2: Highlighting articles, agreements, or principles of the UNFCCC.

20.	topic_9: No applicable topic.

unit_0 to unit_7: Binary label indicating the unit of distribution indicated in the sentence. Label as 1 if applicable, label as 0 if not applicable. Each unit represents a specific focus, and only one unit can be selected per sentence.
21.	unit_0: Not evaluated. relevance_2 is not 1.
22.	unit_1: General distribution of support.
23.	unit_2: Highlighting responsibility to take action.

29.	shape_0: Not evaluated. relevance_2 is not 1.
30.	shape_1: Shape not indicated in the sentence.
31.	shape_2: Equality-based distribution. Distribution in which the allocation is equal for all. The size of the allocation does not have to be specified.

It does not account for circumstances, focussing on what countries deem that is needed. Examples are found in distributions that call for re-allocation of resources based on what is needed to implement new policies.
35.	shape_6: Proportional to contributions distribution. Distribution based on historical contributions. Otherwise label as 0. Highlighted in relation to historical responsibility for past emissions, where historically higher polluters have to reduce more emissions.
36.	shape_7: Proportional to commitments distribution. Distribution based on commitments made in global agreements, pledges, and treaties. Example: statements calling upon developed countries to act upon their pledges to commit to the green climate fund.
37. shape_8: A shape is highlighted, but no described shape fits
