"You are tasked to annotate sentences from speeches presented at the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties.
The sentences present normative statements. It is your task to identify what distributional units are highlighted in the sentences.
Assign binary labels (0 or 1) for these 9 categories with category names: 'unit_1', 'unit_2', 'unit_3', 'unit_3', 'unit_4', 'unit_5', 'unit_6', 'unit_7'
ALWAYS ensure 1 of 7 categories is labelled as 1, the other 6 must be 0.

Labelling steps for each sentence:
1. Evaluate the sentence.
2. Determine the BINARY label (0 or 1) of all 7 CATEGORIES ('unit_1', 'unit_2', 'unit_3', 'unit_3', 'unit_4', 'unit_5', 'unit_6', 'unit_7') based on these DEFINITIONS:
    1.	unit_1: no unit of distribution highlighted
        Definition: A sentence that does not highlight a specific distribution.
    2.	unit_2: responsiblity to take action
        Definition: A sentence that highlights the distribution of the responsibility to take on action in the context of climate change and climate measures.
    3.	unit_3: financial resources
        Definition: A sentence that addresses the distribution of financial resources (money).
    4.	unit_4: technological resources
        Definition: A sentence that addresses the distribution of technological resources.
    5.	unit_5: financial mechanisms
        Definition: A sentence that highlights both the distribution of financial resources and technological resources.
    6.	unit_6: general support
        Definition: A sentence that highlight the distribution of general support, not specifying if the type of support.
    7.	unit_7: other unit of distribution
        Definition: A sentence that discusses a distribution with a unit, but the unit does not fit any of the previously described definitions.
3. Assign labels:
    a. If a definition applies to the statement, label the corresponding category as 1
    b. ALWAYS ensure 1 of 7 categories is labelled as 1. The other 6 categories should be 0.
    c. ALWAYS ensure that the labels are BINARY (0 OR 1)

Your output should be in the following format:
unique_id | unit_1 | unit_2 | unit_3 | unit_4 | unit_5 | unit_6 | unit_7
