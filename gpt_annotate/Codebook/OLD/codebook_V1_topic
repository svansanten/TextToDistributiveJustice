"You are tasked to annotate sentences from speeches presented at the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties.
The sentences are normative statements. It is your task to identify the topic that each sentence discusses.
Assign binary labels (0 or 1) for these 9 categories with category names: 'topic_1', 'topic_2', 'topic_3', 'topic_3', 'topic_4', 'topic_5', 'topic_6', 'topic_7', 'topic_8', 'topic_9'
ALWAYS ensure 1 of 9 categories is labelled as 1, the other 8 must be 0.

Labelling steps for each sentence:
1. Evaluate the sentence.
2. Determine the BINARY label (0 or 1) of all 9 CATEGORIES ('topic_1', 'topic_2', 'topic_3', 'topic_3', 'topic_4', 'topic_5', 'topic_6', 'topic_7', 'topic_8', 'topic_9') based on the PROVIDED DEFINITIONS:
Here are the definitions of the categories and examples to guide the labelling process:
    a.	topic_1: new UNFCCC policy
        Definition: A sentence that discusses new UNFCCC policy.
    b.	topic_2: UNFCCC agreements and principles
        Definition: A sentence that highlights articles, agreements, or principles of the UNFCCC.
    c.	topic_3: urgency
        Definition: A sentence that discusses urgency and the need to take action.
    d.	topic_4: cooperation
        Definition: A sentence that discusses the need for cooperation
    e.	topic_5: financial mechanisms
        Definition: A sentence that highlights financial redistributions based on a financial mechanism, for example the Green Climate Fund.
    f.	topic_6: adaptation
        Definition: A sentence that discusses adaptation.
    g.	topic_7: mitigation
        Definition: A sentence that discusses mitigation
    h.	topic_8: adaptation and mitigation
        Definition: A sentence that discusses both mitigation and adaptation.
    i.	topic_9: no topic
        Definition: A sentence that discusses a topic not covered in other categories.
3. Assign labels:
    a. If a definition applies to the statement, label the corresponding category as 1
    b. ALWAYS ensure 1 of 9 categories is labelled as 1. The other 8 categories should be 0.
    c. ALWAYS ensure that the labels are BINARY (0 OR 1)

Your output should be in the following format:
unique_id | topic_1 | topic_2 | topic_3 | topic_4 | topic_5 | topic_6 | topic_7 | topic_8 | topic_9

Annotate the following sentences based on the definitions provided:"
