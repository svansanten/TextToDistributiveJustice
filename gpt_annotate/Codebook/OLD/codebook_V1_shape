"You are tasked to annotate sentences from speeches presented at the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties.
The sentences are normative statements. It is your task to identify the preferred distributional shapes highlighted in the sentences.
Assign binary labels (0 or 1) for these 7 categories with category names: 'shape_1', 'shape_2', 'shape_3', 'shape_4', 'shape_5', 'shape_6', 'shape_7'
ALWAYS ensure 1 of 7 categories is labelled as 1, the other 6 must be 0.

Labelling steps for each sentence:
1. Evaluate the sentence.
2. Determine the BINARY label (0 or 1) of all 7 CATEGORIES ('shape_1', 'shape_2', 'shape_3', 'shape_4', 'shape_5', 'shape_6', 'shape_7') based on these DEFINITIONS:
    1.	shape_1: no shape of distribution highlighted
        Definition: A sentence that does highlight a distribution but no shape of the distribution.
    2.	shape_2: equality
        Definition: Label shape_2 as 1 if described shape is equality based: distribution in which the allocation is equal for all. The size of the allocation does not have to be specified.
        Example of shape_2: sentences highlighting the need for “everyone to take action”, indicating that equality is favoured in the distribution of the obligation to take measures. A sentence that highlights the distribution of the responsibility to take on action in the context of climate change and climate measures.
    3.	shape_3: equity
        Definition: Label shape_3 as 1 if described shape is equity based:distribution that accounts for differences between the recipients, e.g. accounting for financial situation in a country.
    4.	shape_4: priority to worst off
        Definition: Label shape_4 as 1 if described shape prioritized the worst off: distribution that solely focuses on distribution to the ones that are deemed the worst off, e.g. the distribution of financial resources to resources to countries that are most vulnerable to climate impacts.
    5.	shape_5: needs based
        Definition: Label shape_5 as 1 if described shape is needs based: distribution prioritizing the distribution based on the needs people have. It does not account for circumstances, only focussing on what countries deem that is needed.
        Examples of shape_5 are found in distributions that call for re-allocation of resources based on what is needed to implement new policies.
    6.	shape_6: proportional to contribution
        Definition: Label shape_6 as 1 if described shape is proportional to contributions: distribution based on historical contributions. Highlighted in relation to historical responsibility for past emissions, where historically higher polluters have to reduce more emissions.
    7.	shape_7: proportional to commitment
        Definition: Label shape_7 as 1 if described shape is proportional to commitments: distribution based on commitments made in global agreements, pledges, and treaties.
        Example of shape_7 is found in statements calling upon developed countries to act upon their pledges to commit to the green climate fund.
3. Assign labels:
    a. If a definition applies to the statement, label the corresponding category as 1
    b. ALWAYS ensure 1 of 7 categories is labelled as 1. The other 6 categories should be 0.
    c. ALWAYS ensure that the labels are BINARY (0 OR 1)

Your output should be in the following format:
unique_id | shape_1 | shape_2 | shape_3 | shape_4 | shape_5 | shape_6 | shape_7

Annotate the following sentences based on the definitions provided:"
