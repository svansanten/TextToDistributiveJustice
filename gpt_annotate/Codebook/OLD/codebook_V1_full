"You are presented with speeches presented by parties during the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties. You will evaluate each sentence for the following five elements:
a)	relevance
label relevance_2 as 1: when it presents a normative statement and presents a value judgement or prescription based on norms and values. A complete normative statement also includes a motivation for the claim that is made, or this motivation can
be derived from textual context. An example is found in “X should be done because Y”. Statements that prescribe normative elements that should be considered in new policies are also seen as relevant. Otherwise label as 0.
label relevance_1 as 1: when its normativity can be seen as ambiguous. These sentences refer to policy intentions (“we will do X”) or expectations that are not supported by any normative motivations but do prescribe an action or behaviour. Otherwise label as 0.
label relevance_0 as 1: when it presents a descriptive or factual statement describing a phenomenon, situation, or object. Examples are found in descriptions of policies that are already implemented in a country. All statements expressing gratitude, other formalities,
or rhetoric questions are also deemed not relevant. Otherwise label as 0.

b) principle
This element is only labelled when relevance_2 == 1, if relevance_2 ==0, label principle_0 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.

Label the principle that is foundational in the expression of normative judgement or prescriptions based on moral values. It can be seen as the motivation where a statement is based on. Choose only one label.
If not one principle can be applied or if it is unclear what principle is used, label principle_1 as 1, otherwise label as 0. This indicates a general normative statement.
The following definitions are used for the labels:
label principle_2 as 1 if presenting an egalitarian motivation. Motivated by the goal to reduce inequalities and have equality of opportunity. This includes statements the highlight the inclusion of all and references to mutual contributions by all. Otherwise label as 0.
label principle_3 as 1 if presenting an utilitarian motivation. Motivated by the goal of maximizing the benefit of all or contributing to ‘the greater good’. The benefit of all can be in present and future generations. Otherwise label as 0.
label principle_4 as 1 if presenting a prioritarian motivation. Motivated by the moral obligation to help the worst off. Highlighted in sentences focussing on supporting vulnerable developing countries. It does not focus existing differences. Otherwise label as 0.
label principle_5 as 1 if presenting a sufficientarian motivation. Motivated by the idea that everyone should be able to reach a common level of well-being. Found in sentences referring to a global standard of well-being that everyone should reach
as well as statements implying that no one should be left behind this threshold. Otherwise label as 0.
label principle_6 as 1 if presenting a libertarian motivation. Motivated by a need for freedom, indicating minimal government involvement and focus on free markets. Otherwise label as 0.
Example: Prescribing the need to take action, motivated by the need to improve the lives of all, would be labelled as utilitarian.

c) topic
This element is only labelled when relevance_2 == 1, if relevance_2 ==0, label topic_0 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.

Label relevant sentences for the topic it discusses. Only one topic can be selected.
When sentences discuss requirements for new UNFCCC policy, label topic_1 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.

Both adaptation and mitigation, label topic_8 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.
If no topic applies to the sentence, label topic_9 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.

d) unit
This element is only labelled when relevance_2 == 1, if relevance_2 ==0, label unit_0 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.
Label relevant sentences for the unit of the distribution they indicate. Only one unit can be selected. If a distribution is not indicated, label unit_1 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.
If the sentence highlights a responsibility to take on action, label unit_2 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.
If the sentence focuses on the distribution of financial resources, label unit_3 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.
If the sentence focuses on technological resources, label unit_4 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.
Both technological and financial resources, label unit_5 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.
Does the sentence discuss a general distribution of support, not specifying if this is technological or financial, label unit_6 as 1. Otherwise label as 0.
If no unit applies, label unit_7 as 1.Otherwise label as 0.

e) shape
This element is only labelled when relevance_2 == 1, if relevance_2 ==0, label shape_0 as 1, otherwise label as 0.

If indicated, the shape of the distribution that is presented in the statement. Select only 1 shape from the provided labels. If a statement does not imply a shape, label shape_1 as 1, otherwise label as 0.
The following distributions are indicated by the labels:
Label shape_2 as 1 if described shape is equality based: distribution in which the allocation is equal for all. The size of the allocation does not have to be specified. Otherwise label as 0.
Example of shape_2: sentences highlighting the need for “everyone to take action”, indicating that equality is favoured in the distribution of the obligation to take measures.
Label shape_3 as 1 if described shape is equity based:distribution that accounts for differences between the recipients, e.g. accounting for financial situation in a country. Otherwise label as 0.
Label shape_4 as 1 if described shape prioritized the worst off: distribution that solely focuses on distribution to the ones that are deemed the worst off, e.g. the distribution of financial
resources to countries that are most vulnerable to climate impacts. Otherwise label as 0.
Label shape_5 as 1 if described shape is needs based: distribution prioritizing the distribution based on the needs people have. It does not account for circumstances, focussing on what countries
deem that is needed. Otherwise label as 0. Examples are found in distributions that call for re-allocation of resources based on what is needed to implement new policies.
Label shape_6 as 1 if described shape is proportional to contributions: distribution based on historical contributions. Otherwise label as 0. Highlighted in relation to historical responsibility for past emissions, where historically higher polluters have to reduce more emissions.
Label shape_7 as 1 if described shape is proportional to commitments: distribution based on commitments made in global agreements, pledges, and treaties. Otherwise label as 0.
Example of shape_7 is found in statements calling upon developed countries to act upon their pledges to commit to the green climate fund.

Use the previous and next two sentences into account as context to the sentence you are evaluating.
