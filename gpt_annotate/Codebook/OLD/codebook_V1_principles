"You are tasked to annotate sentences from speeches presented at the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties.
The sentences are normative statements. It is your task to identify by what Distributive Justice principle is foundational to the statement.
Assign binary labels (0 or 1) for 6 categories with category names: principle_1, principle_2, principle_3, principle_4, principle_5, principle_6. Follow the provided definitions of the categories during labelling process.
ALWAYS ensure 1 of 6 categories is labelled as 1, the other 5 must be 0.

Labelling steps for each sentence:
1. Evaluate the sentence.
2. Determine the BINARY label (0 or 1) of all 6 CATEGORIES (principle_1, principle_2, principle_3, principle_4, principle_5, principle_6) based on the PROVIDED DEFINITIONS:
Here are the definitions of the categories and examples to guide the labelling process:
    a.	principle_1: general normative statement
        Definition: A sentence that presents no indication of foundational distributive justice principle that is used as a motivation for the normative statement.
        Example: The major polluters, especially those who are most responsible for climate change, have the moral obligation to do much more, to take the lead and to raise their ambition now. Explanation: Presents normative judgement on responsibility of major polluters to take on action. This directly tied to article 4 of the convention, common but differentiated responsibilities. It highlights a distribution of responsibility proportional to past contributions to climate change. The motivational principle cannot be derived, leading to the label of general normative statement. Although CBDR can be seen as an egalitarian motivated principle, this statement does not call for contributions by all, focussing on the major polluters.  The statement could also be motivated utilitarian, arguing that that the moral obligation to help would be in the benefit of all. This ambiguity has led to the label: general normative statement.
    b.	principle_2: egalitarian motivation
        Definition: A sentence presenting an egalitarian motivation. Motivated by the goal to reduce inequalities and have equality of opportunity. This includes statements the highlight the inclusion of all and references to mutual contributions by all.
        Example: All nations must raise their ambition and implement significant sector wide emission reductions as a matter of urgency.
    c.	principle_3: utilitarian motivation
        Definition: A sentence presenting a utilitarian motivation. Motivated by the goal of maximizing the benefit of all or contributing to ‘the greater good’. The benefit of all can be in present and future generations. Found in sentences prescribing the need to take action, motivated by the need to improve the lives of all.
        Example: We must activate all our efforts to preserve the environment for future generations, and related to it I would like to thank to all those who, despite the many obstacles and difficulties, continue
        in these efforts. Explanation: Normative statement prescribing the need to take on actions, motivated by the need to protect the environment for future generations. This indicates a utilitarian motivation. No unit or shape of a distribution is indicated, other than a general need to take on action. This statement expresses both a prescriptive normative statement and expresses gratitude. Due to the normative section, the statement is labelled as relevant.
    d. 	principle_4: prioritarian motivation
        Definition: A sentence presenting a prioritarian motivation. Motivated by the moral obligation to help the worst off. Highlighted in sentences focussing on supporting vulnerable developing countries. It does not focus existing differences.
        Example: The Green Climate Fund, which we regarded as an ideal beginning to address the finance aspect for climate change remains dry. Explanation: Presents normative judgement on the lac of resources in the Green Climate Fund. This fund is developed to help developing countries in their implementation of climate measures, making it prioritarian in nature. The unit of the distribution is financial resources. The preferred shape, relating to the distribution of financial resources in a financial mechanism, is not specifically indicated.
    e. 	principle_5: sufficientarian motivation
        Definition: A sentence presenting a sufficientarian motivation. Motivated by the idea that everyone should be able to reach a common level of well-being. Found in sentences referring to a global standard of well-being that everyone should reach as well as statements implying that no one should be left behind this threshold.
        Example: The longer we wait, the more it will cost; more victims will suffer from our inaction and
        the greatest weight will fall on the most vulnerable, the poorest peoples and future generations: what is at issue here is respect for their fundamental human rights. Explanation: Presents a normative statement prescribing the need to take action. This prescription is motivated by the respect for fundamental human rights. These rights are seen as a global baseline level that everyone should reach, making the motivation sufficientarian. There is no specific distribution prescribed, only the need to take on action.
    f. 	principle_6: libertarian motivation
        Definition: A sentence presenting a libertarian motivation. label principle_6 as 1 if presenting a libertarian motivation. Motivated by a need for freedom, indicating minimal government involvement and focus on free markets.
        Example: We should make the most of these opportunities by developing and implementing innovative solutions, enabling our businesses to contribute to, and benefit from, the global transition towards a carbon -neutral economy. Explanation: Normative statement with focus on achieving a carbon-neutral economy by supporting businesses. The explicit focus on economics and business is also found in the libertarian principle valuing an economical and market based approach to new policies. No unit or shape of a distribution are indicated.
3. Assign labels:
    a. If a definition applies to the statement, label the corresponding category as 1
    b. ALWAYS ensure 1 of 6 categories is labelled as 1. The other 5 categories should be 0.
    c. ALWAYS ensure that the labels are BINARY (0 OR 1)

Your output should be in the following format:
unique_id | principle_1 | principle_2 | principle_3 | principle_4 | principle_5 | principle_6
