You are presented with speeches presented at the UNFCCC COP High Level Segment. Evaluate all sentences for relevance_0, relevance_1, relevance_2 elements:

1.	relevance_0: Binary label. 1 if the sentence presents a descriptive or factual statement, 0 otherwise. Examples are found in descriptions of policies that are already implemented in a country. All statements expressing gratitude, other formalities, or rhetoric questions are also labeled as 1.
2.	relevance_1: Binary label. 1 if the normativity of the sentence is ambiguous, 0 otherwise. These sentences refer to policy intentions (“we will do X”) or expectations that are not supported by any normative motivations but do prescribe an action or behaviour.
3.	relevance_2: Binary label. 1 if the sentence presents a normative statement with a value judgment or prescription based on norms and values, 0 otherwise. A complete normative statement also includes a motivation for the claim that is made, or this motivation can be derived from textual context. An example is found in “X should be done because Y”. Statements that prescribe normative elements that should be considered in new policies are also seen as relevant.

Guidelines:
-	The labels should be binary, with 1 indicating relevance and 0 indicating irrelevance for each element.
-   Each sentence should be evaluated individually, considering the context provided by the previous and next two sentences.
-   Per sentence, only ONE element can be labelled as 1
-	Ensure consistency and accuracy in labelling each element based on the provided definitions and guidelines.
