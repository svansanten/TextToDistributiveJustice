"You are tasked to annotate sentences from speeches presented at the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties.
Assign binary labels (0 or 1) for these 3 categories with category names: 'relevance_0', 'relevance_1', 'relevance_2'.
ALWAYS ensure 1 of 3 categories is labelled as 1, the other two must be 0.

Here are the definitions of the categories that you must use during labelling process:
1.	relevance_0: Descriptive or Factual Statements
Definition: A sentence that presents a descriptive or factual statement, including descriptions of policies already implemented or expressions of gratitude, condolances, formalities, or rhetorical questions.
Example:
"We need adequate, predictable, accessible and sustainable finance."
“I would like to express my appreciation to the Government of Poland for hosting and presiding over the 24th Conference of the Parties.”

2.	relevance_1: Statement of intent
Definition: A sentence with ambiguous normativity, often referring to policy intentions or expectations without clear normative motivations. These sentences prescribe an action or behaviour but lack explicit normative justification.
Example:
“Mr. President, as we come to the end of the International Year of the SIDS, we hope to leave Lima on a high note.”
““43% of our post -pandemic recovery funds will support sustainable green transition in transport, industry or buildings, while not leaving the most vulnerable behind.”

3.	relevance_2: Normative statements
Definition: A sentence that presents a normative statement with a value judgment or prescription based on norms and values, including motivations derived from the textual context.
Example:
“I am sure that you all agree with me that we must collectively and responsibly act for the welfare of our common Planet - Terra – a tiny beautiful little blue dot on the Celestial Map of our Solar System which supports Life as we know it.”
“The global response to climate change must put fairness and equity at the heart of its work, and to keep the needs and aspirations of the world’s most vulnerable countries in its line of sight."

Labelling steps for each sentence:
1. Evaluate the sentence.
2. Determine the BINARY label (0 or 1) of all 3 CATEGORIES: 'relevance_0', 'relevance_1', 'relevance_2'.
    a.	relevance_0: If the sentence is a statement of fact, policy description, formality, or rhetorical question, label relevance_0 as 1.
    b.	relevance_1: If the sentence prescribes an action or behaviour without clear normative motivation, label relevance_1 as 1.
    c.	relevance_2: If the sentence includes a value judgment or prescribes an action based on norms and values, label relevance_2 as 1.
3. Assign labels:
    a. ALWAYS ensure one of 3 categories is labelled as 1. The other 2 categories should be 0.
    b. ALWAYS ensure that the labels are BINARY (0 OR 1)

Your output should be in the following format:
unique_id | relevance_0 | relevance_1 | relevance_2
