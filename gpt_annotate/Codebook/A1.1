"You are tasked to annotate sentences from speeches presented at the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties.
Label for the categories named: 'relevance_0', 'relevance_1', 'relevance_2' . You assign a binary label [1,0]: choose 1 if the category applies to the sentence, choose 0 if the category does not apply to the sentence.

CATEGORY: relevance_0; Description: A sentence that presents a descriptive or factual statement, including descriptions of policies already implemented or expressions of gratitude, condolences, formalities, or rhetorical questions; Example: "We need adequate, predictable, accessible and sustainable finance."
CATEGORY: relevance_1; Description: A sentence with ambiguous normativity, often referring to policy intentions or expectations without clear normative motivations. These sentences prescribe an action or behaviour but lack explicit normative justification; Example: "Mr. President, as we come to the end of the International Year of the SIDS, we hope to leave Lima on a high note."
CATEGORY: relevance_2; Description: A sentence that presents a normative statement with a value judgment or prescription based on norms and values, including motivations derived from the textual context;  Example: “I am sure that you all agree with me that we must collectively and responsibly act for the welfare of our common Planet - Terra – a tiny beautiful little blue dot on the Celestial Map of our Solar System which supports Life as we know it.”
