Statement by His Excellency Mr. Yeshey Penjor
Hon’ble Minister,
Ministry of Agriculture and Forest,
Royal Government of Bhutan
at the High Level Segment of COP26/CMP16/CMA3 to UNFCCC, Glasgow, the
UK
November 9, 2019
Mr. President,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At
the
outset,
let
me
congratulate
you
on
your
election
as
the
President
of
COP26.
On
behalf
of
the
Bhutanese
delegation,
I
also
would
like
to
thank
the
United
Kingdom
and
people
of
Scotland
for
the
warm
hospitality
and
excellent
arrangements
made
for
the
conference.
With
great
pleasure,
I
have
the
privilege
to
acknowledge
the
kindness,
friendliness
nature
of
the
security
force,
volunteers
and
every
individual
citizen
of
Glasgow
city.
Everywhere
we
went,
people
were
so
friendly
and helpful.
From
COP26,
Bhutan
as
the
Chair
of
the
LDCs
Group
and
as
a
highly
vulnerable
country,
I
would
like
to
appeal
to
the
COP26
Presidency
andthe
negotiating
partners
to
consider;
scaling
up
finance
for
Adaptation,
Loss
and
damages,
technology
transfer
and
capacity
building
to
enable
us
recover
from
the
impacts
of
severe
impacts
of
climate
induced
disasters.
LDCs
do
not
contribute
to
GHG
emissions
but
bear
the
brunt
of
the
climate
change
impacts.
Water
resources,
agriculture
and
infrastructure
for
life,
food
security
and
livelihood
are
at
risk
in
the
fragile
mountain
ecosystems
of
countries
like
Bhutan.
We
are
imposed
on,
with
loss
and
damages
frequently
induced
by
climate
disasters.
As
such,
Adaptation
is
a
priority
for
us.
Adaptation
therefore
must
be
supported
with
grants
in
finance.
We
would
like
our
partners
to
live
upto
the
US$100
billion
climate
finance
commitment
and
Adaptation
must
receive equal share in climate financing.
Mr. President!
Bhutan
under
the
policy
guidance
of
our
Environmental
Champion
Monarchs
have
demonstrated
enough
leadership
in
environmental
conservation
and
our
low
emission
development
policy
for
climate
change
and
sustainable
development
goals
are
committed.
Just
to
set
the
tone
with
an
example,
we
are
committed
to
go
e-mobility
in
our
transport
sector
and
energy
efficient
housing
to
transform
from
fossil
fuels
run
transport
and
domestic
cooking
and
heating.
Initiating
electric
train
transport,
increasing
electric
vehicles
in
public
and
privatetransport
across
the
country
is
an
immediate
target
in
our
country.
We
would
like
to
invite
investors;
governments,
multinational
donors,
INGOs,
and
the
private
sector
to
support
such
green
initiatives
in
our
country.
The
COVID-19
pandemic
has
hit
everyone
around
the
globe.
But
poorer
nations
already
impacted
by
the
climate
crisis
are
the
worst
hit.
We
would
like
to
request
leaders
to
consider
post
pandemic
economic
support rather than attempting to recover to pre-pandemic status.
Mr. President!
Let
me
echo
other
Hindu
Kush
Himalayas
initiatives
and
three
messages
of
the
region.
The
water
tower
of
the
world
is
the
worst
hit
and
with
the
slightest
temperature
rise
can
have
detrimental
effects
on
its
glaciers
and
downstream,
as
confirmed
by
the
latest
IPCC
report.
We
need
regional
cooperation
and
global
support
in
saving
the
Himalayas
and
the
livelihoods
of
240
million
people
living
within
these
mountain
ecosystems.
Mr. President!
While
Bhutan
acknowledges
and
welcomes
the
COP26
Presidency’s
“
c l i m a t e
f i n a n c e
d e l i v e r y
p l a n :
m e e t i n g
t h e
U S $
1 0 0
b i l l i o n
g o a l ”
,
and
the
contributions
committed
by
partners
in
LDCF
replenishment,
wewould
like
to
reiterate
that
climate
finance
must
be
predictable,
easily
accessible
and
sustainable
based
on
the
priorities
and
needs
of
the
vulnerable
countries.
Countries
that
are
committed
and
have
provided
leadership prominence must be recognized with funding assurances.
As
we
approach
the
final
week
of
the
COP26,
lots
need
to
be
done
to
conclude
remaining
work
for
implementing
the
Paris
Agreement.
We
must
speed
up
to
deliver
ambitious,
concrete
and
enhanced
climate
action
and
support.
For
Bhutan,
let
me
once
again
reiterate
that
COP26
must
deliver
concrete
decisions
on
enhanced
ambition,
adaptation,
loss
and
damage,
robust
rule
for
implementation
of
market
and
non-market
mechanism
that
ensures
environmental
integrity
and
enhanced
financial
support for climate action.
Mr. President!
Bhutan
remains
committed
to
the
principles
and
objectives
of
the
Convention
and
Paris
Agreement
and
calls
on
all
Parties
to
be
flexible,
open
and
constructive
to
deliver
a
strong
climate
action
and
support.
Our
actions
today
will
go
a
long
way
towards
securing
a
green
and
sustainable future for generations to come.
Thank you and Tashi Delek!
