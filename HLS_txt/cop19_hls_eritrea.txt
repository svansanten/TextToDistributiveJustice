 Mr. President, 
Excellencies, 
Distinguished delegates, 
Ladies and gentlemen 
I take the honor to make this statement on behalf of the 
delegation of Eritrea.  
At the outset I would like to join previous speakers to 
express my delegation’s appreciation to the government 
and people of Poland for hosting COP19/CMP9 and for 
the kind hospitality given to us since arrival in this 
beautiful and heroic city of Warsaw. 
Mr. President our planet is encountering very critical 
climate challenges . Urgent issue as they are, these 
challenges have been  discussed at international level for 
quite a long time now ; but without the final outcome 
that all should cherish . 
In light of the formidable peril, if not existential 
challenges , that unfettered climate change has already 
entailed and as science has predicted with great 
confidence , will inevitably entail to posterity,
 my delegation is worried by the overall inadequate response 
of the human family . We would like to note that 
inadequate mitigation ambition and action to maintain 
global temperature rise below what is confirmed as the 
limit by science as well the delayed implementation of 
already concluded agreements underscored by lack of 
political will and commitment of the countries that can 
really make a difference to save our planet from the 
perilous path to obliteration , as well as the co mplicated 
and dragging process of the negotiation , to which all of 
us seem to get used, are no source of consolation and 
confidence building . 
However, knowing there is no other safe alternative for 
all countries, we cannot but still insist to push and hope 
for a fair, ambitious and equitable final outcome under 
the Convention in accordance with its principles that will 
include mitigation, adaptation and means of 
implementation.  
My delegation reiterates Eritrea’s firm position that the 
UNFCCC and KP constitute the fundamental global legal 
instrument on climate change regime and calls for the 
High Level Segment of COP19/CMP9 here in Warsaw to; 
 underline the dire need for enhancing and 
inseparably linking adaptation and mitigation actions 
and ambitions to be embodied both in the pre and 
post -2020 work -streams with full account of the 
means of implementation and in conformity with the 
principles of the Convention; 
 build on and strengthen existing arrangements 
unde r the Green Climate Fund and to move the Fund 
from mere operationalsion to capitalization with 
clear and defined sources and channels towards 
2020;  
 establish arrangements for putting commitments 
forward to enable ex-anti information for all 
elements of the ADP; 
 pave the ground work for short, medium and long 
term global goals that include enhanced ambitious 
mitigation commitments by Annex 1 Parties through 
mitigation numbers based on s cience, equity, CBDR -
RC and agreed upon robust MRV mechanisms ; 
 urge developed country parties to support 
addressing loss and damage through appropriate global 
and national institutional arrangements, 
including other special needs and concerns of LDCs; 
 call upon Annex 1 Parties that are not under taking 
commitments under KP2 to undertake commitments 
with enhanced ambitions ; 
 insist on developed country parties to provide new 
and additional resources to the climate funds under 
the Convention which are adequate, predicta ble, 
sustainable and accessible; and 
 encourage all parties to fulfill their commitments 
under the framework of the anticipated 
comprehensive 2015agreement under the 
Convention. 
 
I thank you.
