Excellencies,  
 
I am before you not only as the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda but as 
a voice for all small island states, suffocating under the weight of a crisis we 
did not create.  
 
Our beautiful islands, once paradises on Earth, now stand on the front lines of 
a global war against climate change - a war where we are the greatest 
casualties although we are the least contributors to the conflict. 
 
We are facing an existential paradox: t he smallest contributors to global CO2 
emissions, yet among the hardest hit by climate catastrophes.  
 
This is not just an environmental crisis; it is a glaring testament to a world 
order where profits are prioritized over people and planet. 
 
It is a world where oil and gas conglomerates, shielded by the power of 
wealthy nations, continue to reap astronomical profits while the survival of 
nations like ours hangs in the balance. 
 
The irony is as bitter as it is unjust.  
 
The global com munity made promises in Paris, yet the pace of change is 
lethargically slow, dangerously incremental.  
 
We must confront this reality: if we breach the 1.5 degrees threshold, the 
consequences will be catastrophic, not just for small islands but for the entire 
world.  
 
The weapons of m ass destruction of our time are not explosive devices, but 
rising temperatures, scorching droughts, and relentless sea level rise - all 
consequences of unchecked avarice and apathy. 
 
Our proposal for a carbon tax, backed by nations like France and Kenya, is 
not just a call for action; it is a plea for justice.  
 
We stand firm in our support for a Fossil Fuel Non -Proliferation Treaty.  
Itâ€™s time to curb the reckless exploitation of fossil fuels. 
Let me be clear: The path we choose today will determine the fate of 
generations to come.  
 
We call for bold, immediate actions: a relentless pursuit of the 1.5 degrees 
goal, substantial funding for loss and damage, and transformative finance that 
respects our vulnerability. 
 
We must act with the urgency this crisis demands. 
 
We must act now.
