by 
 
SECRETARY RAMON J.P. PAJE 
Department of Environment and Natural Resources 
The Philippines 
 
at COP 21, Le Bourget, Paris, France 
on 8 December 2015 . 
 
MR. PRESIDENT, 
 
THE PHILIPPINES, IN ITS INCUMBENCY AS PRESIDENT OF THE CLIMATE 
VULNERABLE FORUM , IS IN UNITY WITH THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY IN 
URGENTLY PURSUING ITS NATIONAL A CTION WHILE CALLING FOR 
GLOBAL COMMITMENTS TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOST 
VULNERABLE COUNTRIES. 
 
AS EMBODIED IN THE MANILA COMMUNIQUE, THE PHILIPPINES BEING 
SUPPORTED BY 112 NATIONS SHALL SUSTAIN ITS COMMITMENT TO 
UNDERTAKE ACTIONS THAT WILL FAST -TRACK ADVANCEMENT 
TOWARDS THE GOAL OF LIMITING THE GLOBAL AVERAGE 
TEMPERATURE BELOW 1.5 -DEGREES CELSIUS. 
 
IT IS ENCOURAGING TO KNOW THAT THIS 21ST SESSION OF THE 
CONFERENCE OF PARTIES HERE IN PARIS HAS PROVIDED FURTHER 
VENUE FOR OTHER STATES, CIVIL SOCIETY AND YOUTH GROUPS TO 
DEC LARE SUPPORT TO THIS AMBITIOUS 1.5OC LIMIT. 
 
DESPITE THE PARTICULAR OUTCOME OF THE NE GOTIATIONS THAT 
WEAKENS THE REVIEW OF THE 2 -DEGREES GOAL, THE CLIMATE 
VULNERABILITY FORUM SUSTAINS ITS MOMENTUM TO HAVE 
ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES SHOW THEIR SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT WITH THE FORUM AS REFLECTED IN THEIR STATEMENT S AT COP 21 WHICH 
CALLED FOR THE PA RIS AGREEMENT “TO SET OUT A CLEAR DIRECTION 
OF TRAVEL, WITH COLLECTIVELY AGREED AMBITIOUS TARGETS BUILT 
AROUND THE 1.5C LONG TERM TEMPERATURE GOAL.” 
 
INDEED, THIS CLIMATE CRISIS AFFECTS US ALL – DEVELOPED, 
DEVELOPING AND LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. AND THIS CRISIS 
HAS PROVIDED US THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE BASIS OF UNITY TO 
RESPOND TO THESE CHALLENGES AND TO COLLECTIVELY TAKE ON THE 
FOLLOWING AGREED ACTIONS HERE IN PARIS NOW AND BEYOND : 
FIRST, TO STRENGTHEN OUR LEADERSHIP IN TAKING NATIONAL 
CLIMATE ACTIONS TO ENSURE PROGRESS TOWARD S THE GOAL 
OF STAYING BELOW 1.5 °C, UPSCALING OUR OWN MITIGATION 
ACTIONS AND ACCELERATING OUR CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FOR 
ADAPTATION. 
SECOND, TO WORK IN SOLIDARITY WITH DEVELOPED COUNTRIES 
TO PUT IN PLACE ACTIONS ON LOSS AND D AMAGE CONSISTENT 
WITH THE WARSAW INTERNATIONAL MECHANISM TO ENSURE 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE ENABLED TO MANAGE CLIMATE 
RISKS. 
AND LASTLY, TO CALL FOR THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY TO HASTEN 
MEANS BY WHICH VULNERABLE COUNTRIES ARE ABLE TO 
ACCESS PREDICTABLE, AND SCALED-UP CLIMATE FINANCE, 
WHILE DIRECTING OUR OWN RESOURCES AND CAPACITIES 
TOWARDS CLIMATE ACTIONS. 
 
 MR. PRESIDENT 
 
THE PHILIPPINE DELEGATION IS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PROVISION IN THE DRAFT PARIS 
AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR ADAPTATION FINANCE FOR THE 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MOST VULNERABLE TO THE ADVERSE 
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.  IN THE CURRENT DRAFT AGREEMENT, 
SPECIFICALLY IN ARTICLE 6, THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO THE AMOUNT 
OF FINANCE NEEDED FOR ADAPTATION. 
 
MY DEL EGATION HEREBY FURTHER INTERVENES TO ENSURE CLEAR 
REFERENCE TO A COLLECTIVE TARGET FOR ADAPTATION WITH A SOLID 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE GOAL FOR TARGET SETTING AND 
PROGRESSION, AND REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS. THIS COLLECTIVE 
TARGET AS WELL AS THE PRE -2020 INTERIM AND MIDTERM ADAPTATION 
PLEDGES SHOULD BE PUBLIC, GRANT -BASED AND CONCRETELY 
ANCHORED ON COUNTRY ADAPTATION NEEDS. 
 
AS STATED IN THE PHILIPPINE S’ INDC, IMPLEMENTATION OF BOTH 
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT TARGETS AND MITIGATION INITIATIVES 
NECESSITATE THE C ONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND STRENGTHENING 
OF THE COUNTRY’S CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITIES. TECHNOLOGY 
TRANSFERS AND INNOVATIONS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT ADAPTATION 
AND MINIMIZATION OF LOSS -AND -DAMAGES AS WELL AS ENHANCED 
CAPACITY FOR MITIGATION. THUS, F ULL IMPLE MENTATION OF OUR 
CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL ACTION REQUIRES SUPPORT IN THE FORM 
OF ADEQUATE, PREDICTABLE AND SUSTAINABLE FINANCING. 
 
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
