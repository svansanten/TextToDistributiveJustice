1. It is my great pleasure to represent His Excellency, Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda, at COP26.
2. I would like to express my appreciation to the United Kingdom for hosting this summit, and to the Government and people of Scotland for your warm hospitality.

3. We are falling short of our duty to both people and the planet if we donâ€™t urgently address climate change.
4. To cut temperatures to below 1.5 degrees, a 45% reduction of emissions is required. This calls for immediate, rapid, and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Excellencies,
5. In Rwanda, we have seen first-hand the impact of climate change. Floods, droughts and landslides have damaged

livelihoods and property, and tragically, cost too many lives.
6. That is why Rwanda is committed to reducing emissions by 38% in the next decade, and reach Net Zero by 2050.
7. Rwanda looks forward to working with partner states and institutions, to ensure our mitigation and adaptation plans can be effectively implemented, and make impactful contribution to global efforts.

8. I take this opportunity to thank every country that has ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, and encourage all remaining parties to do so. If implemented fully, the Amendment could avoid up to 0.4 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century.
9. It is also time for us to come together to realize the potential of the Paris Agreement.
10. Let us keep 1.5 alive, scale up timely and ambitious actions, mobilize finance, and complete

the Paris Rulebook so that there are no more delays to climate action.
11. Rwanda pledges its full support for inclusive and transparent negotiations, and for collaboration and dialogue between partners around the world.
I thank you.
