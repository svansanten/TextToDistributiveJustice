1. It is my great pleasure to 
represent His Excellency, Paul 
Kagame, President of the 
Republic of Rwanda, at COP26 .

3. We are falling short of our duty 
to both people and the planet if 
we don’t urgently address 
climate chang e. 
 
4. To cut temperatures to below 
1.5 degrees, a 45% reduction of 
emissions is required . This calls 
for immediate, rapid, and large -
scale reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
 
Excellencies, 
 
5. In Rwanda, we have seen first -
hand the impact of climate 
change . Floods, droughts and 
landslides have damaged 3 
 
livelihoods and property, and 
tragically, cost too many lives. 
 
6. That is why Rwanda is 
committed to reduc ing 
emissions by 38% in the next 
decade, and reach Net Zero by 
2050. 
 
7. Rwanda looks forward to 
working with partner states and 
institutions , to ensure our 
mitigation and adaptation plans 
can be effective ly implemen ted, 
and make impactful contribution 
to glo bal efforts.

8. I take this opportunity to thank 
every country that has ratified 
the Kigali Amendment to the 
Montreal Protocol, and 
encourage all remaining parties 
to do so. If implemented fully, 
the Amendment could avoid up 
to 0.4 degree s Celsius of 
warming by the end of the 
century. 
 
9. It is also time for us to come 
together to realize the potential 
of the Paris Agreement . 
 
10. Let us keep 1.5 alive, scale up 
timely and ambitious action s, 
mobilize finance , and complete 5 
 
the Paris Rulebook so that there 
are no more delays to climate 
action. 
 
11. Rwanda pledges its full support 
for inclusive and transparent 
negotiations, and for 
collaboration and dialogue 
between part ners around the 
world. 
 
   I thank you .
