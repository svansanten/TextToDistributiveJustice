As mandated by Indonesia’s constitution to protect the right of all citizens for a safe, 
dignified, decent life, and healthy environment , we are committed to enhance pre 2020

We have implemented a number of policies , such as: 
 strengthening one map policy;  
 enforc ing moratorium on primary natural forest conversion ;  
 reviewing existing licenses on peat land;  
 restoring degraded peatland and its ecosystem ; and 
 allocating 12.7 million ha for social forestry program . 
 2 The government has been worki ng closely with all stakeholders including scientists and civil 
societies to enhance prosperity of the people in and surrounding the forest areas.   
 
Our NDC consists of many important commitments, including:  
 In the land sector: reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, 
sustainable management of forest, conservation and enhancement of carbon stocks 
(REDD+ ); 
 
 In the energy sector: development of clean energy sources and an ambitious energy mix 
policy that targets: the use of new and renewable energy of at least 23% in 2025 and 
31% in 2050 , and the use of coal of minimum 30% in 2025 and 25% in 2050 . 
 
Indonesia’s NDC also emphasizes the need for a comprehensive climate change adaptation 
and mitigation strategy , taking into account its unique geographical condition and location . 
 
Transparency, enforcement, and compliance remain fundamental for successful 
implementation of our commitment . Thus, we have established an integrated ‘National 
Registry System’, finance institution, and funding instruments.  
 
Indonesia also believes that beyond sectoral dimension, moral and ethical values as well as 
social dimensions play a significant role in sustainable development, climate change , and 
enhancing national resilience.

Finally, Indonesia is of the view that in preparing the rulebook for implementing Paris

balance to prevent from renegotiating the agreement .
