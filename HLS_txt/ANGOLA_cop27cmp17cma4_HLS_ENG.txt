It is with great honor that on behalf of His Excellency, João Manuel 
Gonç alves Lourenço, President of the Republic of Angola, I 
address this great Summit, in order to effectively contribute to the 
identification of lasting solutions that respond to the global 
challenges related to clima te change. 

Allow me to thank the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt 
for the warm welcome of my Delegation, as well as the Convention 
Secretariat for its support to the Parties in addressing the climate 
agenda that leads us to reflect on the alarming climate emergency 
that humanity face. 

The 26th Conference of the Parties held in Glasgow in 2021 , 
reinforced that the combination of synergies and the coordination 
of joint strategies to combat the climate crisis, is the only way to 
achieve the common good and save our planet. 
 
Excellencies, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 

The Republic of Angola, recognizing that climate change has a 
negativ e impact on the implementation of different development 
plans, approved the National Strategy for Climate Change , 
which establishes a vision until 203 0, aiming to promote the 
transition to a low carbon economy, adapting the national territory 
to the impacts of climate change.  

 As part of the program to combat drought in the south of the 
country, we have implemented water storage infrastructure s, with 
the Cunene River Water Transfer System, the first of several 
structuring projects to combat drought, wi th the creation of 
conditions for the development of agriculture, ensuring greater 
resilience to communities.
 
Angola is also in line with the position of the African group that 
has been taking important initiatives with a view to honoring the 
commitments m ade during COP26. At the national level, we are 
committed to increasing renewable energy sources by up to 70% 
by 2025. 

Regarding the preservation of biodiversity, Angola has increased 
its conservation areas , highlighting the Initiatives of Transfrontier 
Forest Protection of M aiombe that integrates action plans inserted 
in the efforts of the African climate initiative of the Preservation of 
the Congo Basin, an initiative of the Heads of State and 
Government of Central African Countries, reaffirming its 
commitment and responsibility in the fight against climate change 
and deforestation in order to guarantee environmental protection 
and avoid natural disasters. 
 
Excellencies, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
Allow me to state that any strategies to combat climate change will 
not succeed if we do not strengthen international cooperation, 
which plays a central role in sharing knowledge and transferring 
technological and financial resources from indu strialized countries 
to least developing countries highlighting Africa which is a 
continent that less pollutes and suffers more with the consequences 
of such climate change impacts.   
 
Therefore, I would like to recall that last May, during the 
Extraordinary Humanitarian summit and Donor´s Conference 
of the African Union, held in Malabo, Republic of Equatorial 
Guinea, which also included the presence of private sector 
companies, partners and donors , pledges of funding were made 
budgeted at more than USD 100 million , aimed at combating the 
problems linked to climate change and the humanitarian crisis in 
Africa, although there was a somewhat timid attitude towards the 
materialization of the promises. 
 
On the other hand, it is important to emphasize that in relation to 
African continent, the creation of an early warning system and the 
operationalization of the African Humanitarian Agency , are of 
extreme urgency, as they will make it possible to identif y the 
multiple dangers related to climate change, collect and share data 
to respond to the different problems related to climate change, 
including forced displacements. 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
The nexus between climate change and the challenges of peace an d 
security at a global level, especially in Africa, is increasingly 
evident. Rising temperatures, the seas level rise , prolonged 
droughts and other extreme weather effects are affecting the lives 
and livelihoods of communities around the world, worsening 
economic, social or political conditions, leaving vulnerable 
populations very exposed to conflicts and instability. 
 
As champion of the African Union for peace and reconciliation in 
Africa, His Excellency João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço , 
President of the Republic of Angola, considers that the risks and 
threats associated with climate change require a more comprehensive 
in ternational approach that also includes a review 
and adaptation of continental and multilateral peace and security 
mechanisms, so that their instruments of intervention are more 
efficient in their response and consistent with the challenges that 
are emerging in the world. 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
To conclude, we hope that during the summit the member States 
will make pragmatic commitments and coordinate actions to 
control Carbon emissions by investing in alternative energy 
sources that will guarantee the survival of our planet, 
 
Thank you very much!
