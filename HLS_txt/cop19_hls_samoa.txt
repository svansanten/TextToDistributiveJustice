Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The vulnerability of Pacific islands to extreme weather events is a fact.
Scientific information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC 5th Assessment report) confirms that increased storage of thermal
energy in the tropical oceans from climate change will result in tropical
cyclones increasing in their intensity. And the likelihood of extreme natural
disaster events such as Super Typhoon Haiyan can be expected to occur
more frequently in a future where human induced warming of the oceans
continues to grow.
Climate change is therefore an existential issue for Samoa and other lowlying
islands  hence our strong support towards finalizing of a new,
universal, ambitious legally binding agreement within the agreed
timeframes to reflect the science under the ADP with an effective and
equitable compliance regime.
Mr. President
Genuine partnerships are indispensable and a necessity in all our
development efforts and actions to try and mitigate against the impacts of
climate change. Samoa is grateful to its development partners who share
and believe in its concern by providing much needed resources to increase
our resilience to climate change impacts.
The roles of the GEF, Adaptation Fund and GCF are even more critical now
in ensuring that real money flows expeditiously to the neediest of parties.
 
The urgent and timely replenishment of these Funds is vital, as such
support is critical, without which our adaptive capacity will remain
constrained and our decision to embark on an ambitious but essential
undertaking to be carbon-neutral in 2020 would not be realized. The
centrality of partnerships to Samoas sustainable development is the
underpinning why we had proposed as the overarching theme of the 3rd
global conference on SIDS that we are privileged to host in September
2014 the sustainable development of SIDS through genuine and durable
partnerships.
Climate change, and trying to cope with its impacts is a long term
commitment. It is a costly preoccupation  hence the adequacy,
predictability and the timely availability of resources assume greater
significance or we risk weakening our resilience acquired over years.
Notwithstanding what the Warsaw COP is able to deliver, one remains
optimistic that we can continue to count on the support of our partners and
our established multilateral mechanisms as we all share a common concern
and a common cause.
Mr. President, (Loss and Damage)
It was in Cancun in 2010 (COP 16) that Parties to the UN Climate
Convention were mandated to agree on actions to address loss and
damage. Last year in Doha, we agreed to use the Warsaw Conference to
set up the institutional arrangements under the Convention to address this
important issue.
 
That time is now. We need to establish the Warsaw International
Mechanism to address loss and damage, and remove the prevalent and
convenient attempt by some to confuse disaster relief with full
recovery. Disaster relief humanitarian assistance of an immediate and
temporary nature for basic survival, while full recovery addresses the full
return to pre-extreme event situations.
On a more practical notion, a process focused on renewable energy and
energy efficiency involving submissions, technical papers and expert
workshops will ensure fuller understanding of the realities of additional
pressures now faced by the most vulnerable among us in this room
because of climate change exacerbated disasters. About 12 months ago,
Samoa was hit by Cyclone Evan which was unprecedented in severity and
damages it caused. The cost to us in terms of Loss and Damage was well
in excess of US$300 million that has set our economic development many
years back.
Mr President,
Let me return to the central issue that we continuously face  ambition 
or the lack of it especially by countries with the capacity, the resources and
best placed with the leadership role to lead, have continuously fallen short.
The painful reality is that despite all our efforts in the years leading up to
Doha to achieve legally binding commitments, which we all said we
wanted, only four Parties have ratified the Doha Amendment, and none is
a developed country Party. The truth is, we do not have in place a legally

binding second commitment period. Henceforth, 2014 is a year of great
expectations and a time for true leadership. A number of Annex B Parties
are well towards achieving their commitments - largely because these were
not ambitious targets in the first place. We expect the progress they had
made to date be reflected in 2014 in commitments to deeper emission
reductions for the second commitment period, through adjustments to
their Quantified Emission Level Reductions Options (QELROs) over the next
12 months.
Mr. President,
The Pacific island leaders made a commitment in August this year in the
Majuro Declaration for Climate change. Their message is simple but
powerful. Being small and isolated with limited resource-base should not be
a disadvantage. While adaptation efforts against the impacts of climate
change remain a priority for us, we are not limiting ourselves to adaptation
projects only. In Samoa, we always believe that ambition must begin at
home. We have to be part of the global solution by putting our own house
in order first through positive contributions within our means. Thus as a
government, we have established a National Green House Gas Abatement
Strategy premised on a low carbon development pathway that is easily
transformed into a comprehensive Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions
(NAMA) programme towards a carbon neutral energy sector. We also have
exceeded our National Energy Policy target for renewable energy sourcing.
The scale of our effort will be negligible at the global level, but being able
 
to showcase positive examples and being part of the solution, instead of
the problem is important to our country.
I highlight this to underscore both the magnitude and cost of climate
change and the fact that SIDS like Samoa are right up there with the rest
doing our share, often at great expense, to mitigate emissions and adapt
to the adverse effects of climate change within the confines of our
resources.
Mr. President,
Let me conclude by reminding this conference, that so long as we try to
respond to the symptoms of climate change, and not address its root
causes, and as long as vested and narrow interests dictate our national
actions, the price we pay for indecisiveness and inaction in human lives lost
and material costs will continue to escalate exponentially beyond any one
countrys capacity to cope alone.
Finally, we express much appreciation to the government and people of
Poland for their kind hospitality, and commend the organisers of the
meeting for its excellent arrangements.
Thank you.
