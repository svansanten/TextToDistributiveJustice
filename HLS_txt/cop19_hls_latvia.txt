Mr. Chairman, Ministers, Excellences, NGO representatives, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
Latest scientific reports confirm what we had known already long ago  our 
climate is changing. Furthermore, we are witnessing climate change  
almost every day we hear news from across the world about climate change 
related disasters. Yet, we are being warned that th e pace and intensity of 
these processes will c ontinue to increase. 
 
Climate change is the biggest challeng e that humanity has ever faced! And 
although we had known we have to tackle it already some time ago, we are 
still far from adequate actions. 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
In recent years, Latvias economy and its people went through one of the 
hardest periods since the countrys proc lamation 95 years ago. In 2008, after 
years of booming economic success, th e Latvian economy took one of the 
worlds sharpest dives, with its GDP plummeting by over 20%. A very 
gloomy picture, indeed. However, La tvia was committed and is committed 
to contribute towards the mitigation of climate change! We understand that 
everybody is to participate and we are ready to do our share! 
 
In Latvia there are only around two million people but since 2009 we have 
implemented more than 2000 projects aimed at greenhouse gas emission 
reduction. Measures financed through our Green Investment Scheme include 
increase of energy efficiency, technology conversion from fossil to renewable energy sources, developm ent of technologies that reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions as well as rais ing of public awareness with regard 
to the importance and possibilities of greenhouse gas emission reduction. 
We have focused on win-win solutions and therefore despite of the hard 
economic situation we have manage d to positively contribute towards 
climate change mitigation. Moreover, these activities have even advanced 
our economic recovery and Latvia is now back on track, being among the 
top performers in the European Union. By using public funding, we have 
mobilised domestic private investments towards climate action and Ministra E.Spr ūda uzruna

increased public awareness. I strongly be lieve that this is the way forward  
smart synergies of public funding and market-based mechanisms.  
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
A lot has been said here in this room today, yesterday and during the entire 
COP. Yet, currently the progre ss we see is not enough.  
 
I urge all of us to be more engaged, more caring! I believe and aim to prove 
that we can all do better than we have done so far. Millions of people across 
the world look at us and are hoping for us to show the way! We must live up 
to the expectations of the global community! 
 
The Warsaw Conference must delive r an agreement on the process to 
capture ambitious mitigation commitmen ts from all Parties in the 2015 
agreement. Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, Secret ary-General of the United Nations, 
yesterday reminded us a saying that th ree things are good things. This is a 
third COP in Poland and ther efore it must be a good one! 
 According to scientists, there is no ti me to postpone a so lution any longer! 
So? Lets act here and now! Thank you!
