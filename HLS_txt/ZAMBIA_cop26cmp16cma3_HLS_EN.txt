I WISH TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU AND CONGRATULATING, 
YOUR EXCELLENCY PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON, FOR 
CONVENING AND CHAIRING THIS IMPORTANT SUMMIT AT THE 
COMMENCEMENT OF THE 26TH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF 
PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION 
ON CLIMATE CHANGE; 
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE UK PRESIDENCY OF COP -26, UNDER 
YOUR LEADERSHIP WILL DELIVER THE OUTCOME THAT THE 
WORLD URGENTLY NEEDS FOR AVERTING A CLIMATE CRISIS! 
 
CHAIRPERSON , 
SCIENCE IS CLEAR THAT WE ONLY HAVE A SMALL WINDOW OF 
OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT WE COLLECTIVELY TAK E 
DECISIVE ACTION AND PREVENT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE. 
 FOR DEVELOPING AND VULNERABLE COUNTRIES LIKE ZAMBIA, 
WHICH IS AMONG THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WITH 
MULTIPLE CHALLENGES, CLIMATE CHANGE BRINGS AN 
ADDITIONAL LAYER OF CHALLENGES AND AGG RAVATES 
EXISTING ONES; 
CLIMATE CHANGE MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO EFFECTIVELLY 
ADDRESS A NUMBER OF SOCIO -ECONOMIC CHALLENGES IN 
ORDER TO LIFT OUR PEOPLE FROM HIGH POVERTY LEVELS SO AS 
TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVELIHOODS . 
 
CHAIRPERSON , 
FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY, A POSITIVE OUTCOME FROM THIS 
CONFERENCE IS NOT AN OPTION BUT AN ABSOLUTE NECESS ITY. 
WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY WILL SHARE 
OUR SENSE OF URGENCY . 
IF THERE IS ANY LESSON WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THE COVID -
19 PANDEMIC, IT IS THE NEED FOR OUR COLLABORATION ON 
THIS SHARED PLANET IN ORDER TO SECURE OUR MUTUAL SAFETY 
AND SUCCESS. 
WE ARE HOPEFUL AND CONFIDENT THAT IF THE DESIRED 
OUTCOME FR OM THIS SUMMIT AND IN DEED COP -26 IS 
ACHIEVED , WE SHOULD MOVE TO AGREE THE FOLLOWING : 
(i) CLEAR, DEEP AND REAL CUTS IN GREEN HOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS TO B E ADDRESSED BY ALL COUNTRIES 
WITH THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TAKING THE LEAD; 
(ii) ADEQUATE AND PREDICTABLE FINANCING TO ENABLE 
US THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO MAKE IMPACTFUL 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL GLOBAL 
CHALLENGE; 
(iii) SUPPORT WITH TECHNOLOGIES AND TH E CAPACITIES 
THAT THE WORLD NEEDS TO SHIFT FROM CARBON 
INTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PATHS TO LOW CARBON 
GREEN ECONOMIES; 
(iv) PLACING A PREMIUM ON ADAPTATION MEASURES AND 
THE SUPPORT REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT WE 
SAFEGUARD THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF THE 
MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE ON OUR PLANET AND TO 
PROTECT NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS; 
(v) RESOLVING THE REMAINING TECHNICAL 
BOTTLENECKS THAT ARE DELAYING US FROM 
UNLEAS HING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE PARIS 
AGREEMENT . 
 
CHAIRPERSON, 
ZAMBIA IS WILLING AND READY TO SUPPORT YOUR LEAD ERSHIP 
AND WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY IN 
RESOLVING THIS CHALLENGE . 
IN THIS REGARD, I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT PRIOR TO THIS 
SUMMIT IN JULY 2021, ZAMBIA SUBMITTED A REVISED AND 
UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
PARIS AGREEME NT, SPELLING OUT THE FOLLOWING AMBITIOUS 
EFFORTS : 
(a) WE HAVE PLEDGED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS BY 25% BASED ON THE 2010 LEVELS BY 2030 
USING A COMBINATION OF OUR O WN DOMESTIC 
RESOURCES AND OTHER SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE 
TRADITIONALLY RECEIVED; 
(b) WE ARE WILLING AND READY TO GO FURTHER TO REDUCE 
OUR EMISSIONS BY 47% IF WE ARE ADEQUATELY 
SUPPORTED BY OUR GLOBAL PARTNERS; 
(c) WE HAVE INCREASED THE SECTORS UNDER MITIGATION 
FROM THE INITIAL THREE TO SIX IN THE REVISED NDC, 
AS WE STEADILY MOVE TOWARDS AN ECONOMY WIDE 
MITIGATION APPROACH; 
(d) GIVEN THAT ADAPTATION IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF 
OUR NDC, WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED INDICATORS T O 
ENABLE US TRACK PROGRESS ON HOW WE ARE BUILDING 
RESILIENCE IN THE NATURAL AND HUMAN SYSTEMS; 
(e) WE WILL EXPEDITE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITIES 
THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF BANKABLE PROJECT 
PROPOSALS TO ENABLE US ACCESS THE NECESSARY 
FINANCING; 
(f) LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST , IN JUST TWO MONTHS OF OUR 
BEING ELECTED INTO OFFICE BY THE ZAMBIAN PEOPLE, 
WE HAVE CREATED A MINISTRY OF GREEN ECONOMY AND 
ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL SPEARHEAD THE WORK ON 
ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER RELATED 
CHALLENGES IN A ROBUST MANNER. 
CHAIRPERSON, 
AS I CONCLUDE, I WISH TO EMPHASISE THE NEED FOR US ALL TO 
FOSTER A SENSE OF URGENCY AS WE WORK TO GIVE POLITICAL 
MOMENTUM TO OUR NEGOTIATORS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO 
MAKE GOOD USE OF THE NEXT TWO WEEKS TO GIVE THE WORLD 
THE OUTCOME IT NEEDS FROM THIS CONFERENCE. 
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AND NOBLE TASK TO DELIVER FOR OUR 
CITIZENS, THE MUCH NEEDED AND DESIRED CHANGES TO 
PRESERVE THIS PLANET AND SAFEGUARD OUR ENVIRONMENT 
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.  
 
CHAIRPERSON , 
THIS IS OUR DUTY. 
THIS IS OUR INDIVIDUAL, COLLECTIVE AND INDEED, 
INESCAPABLE RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR WORLD, TO OUR PLANET. 
 
I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ATTENTION .
