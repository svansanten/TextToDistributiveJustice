Thank you Mr. President 
 
All Protocol observed 
 
Mr. President, 
 
 
12 years is not a long time… 
Neither my country nor the sum of all emission -reduction 
efforts of the small islands in the world can make a 
significant difference to slow down the advance of 
climate change, though we MUST AND WE WILL do our 
part…Thus we put our hopes in your hands, our global 
brothers and sisters to sit with us at the table and realize 
positive global impact and save our planet. 
 Our reaching a global agreement in Paris encouraged us. 
It added hope to our positive efforts under the UNFCCC 
and built up our belief that global cooperation is possible 
and that the global devastation we are warned about 
almost daily from our scientists can be avoided . But now 
I ask you, do we here at this Conference have the 
collective resolve to make that Agreement real – to turn 
it into action ? 
 
It is NOT a question of whether the goal of limiting global 
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius can be achieved . Rather, 
the question is, will WE here at this Katowice table allow 
it be achieved? 
 
Our experts from the IPCC have spoken.  Let us not let 
the environmental damage be the convincing factor.  Let 
us not let loss of peoples be our mind -changer.  Our 
principles, our future and our planet have spoken.  Our scientists can only warn us, and their grave warning tells 
us that the line of dominoes of climate change is global . 
It is only a matter of time until all of us are impacted …IF… 
action is not taken.  ACTION that can make a difference, 
ACTION that can save our planet. 
 
We are aware that while financing and technologies 
exist, they are not flowing quickly enough to decarbo nize 
the global economy. Billions of dollars are still being 
spent on oil exploration – Those resources must instead 
be directed into the raised sails of renewable energies 
and to help countries like my own to adapt to the 
impacts of climate change that are already upon us. 
 
It is up to us to listen and not wait until it speaks to us as 
a drought, a fire, a typhoon or cyclone, or as a wave over 
our heads. 
 Innovati on and speed is necessary for carbon reduction 
now , but I urge caution in solutions such as 
geoengineering and carbon removal , to be careful of the 
unknown that may yield problems in the future.  We 
have proven means to achieve the goal of limiting global 
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius without putting ourselves 
at risk. 
 
We also have in our hands a sure -fire solution to prevent 
up to 1 degree of global warming ... the Kigali 
Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. 
 
I would like to ask all countries to join me in welcoming 
its entry into force this coming 1 January 2019 , and I 
strongly urge any country that has not ratified it to do so, 
and to make this Amendment a success ! 
 We have to make the rules here , but we must be very 
clear in our minds that our outcomes are not at the 
expense of our planet , and will not allow for acceleration 
of the falling dominoes. 
 
SAVE OUR PLANET , SAVE OUR CHILDREN . 
 
Thank you.
