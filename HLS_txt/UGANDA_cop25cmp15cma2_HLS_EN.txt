FOR ENVIRONMENT OF UGANDA AND HEAD OF DELEGATION  TO 
COP 25/CMP 15 
 
 
 
 
10TH DECEMBER 20192 
 
H.E The President - for the COP Ms. Carolina Schmidt Zaldivar , 
Excellencies 
UNFCCC Executive Secretary Ms. Patriciah Espinosa,  
Heads of Delegations 
Distin guished delegates 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Madam . President, 
Let me begin by express ing my  sincere gratitude for the hospitality 
extended to my delegation and i by the Government s of Chile and Spain. 
 
Uganda associates herself with the statements delivered by Bhuttan on 
behalf of the Least Developed Count ries, Egypt on behalf of the African 
Group and Palestine On Behalf of G77+China. 
 Madam President 
The latest IPCC special reports - on 1.5 degree Celsius, Climate Change 
and Land, and the Ocean and Cryosphere - stress that global warming is 
increasing the severity of droughts, soil erosion and wildfires. And it is 
diminishing crop yields in the tropics and thawing permafrost near the poles. 
Extreme sea level events that used to occur once every hundred years wi ll 
occur at least once a year in many regions around the world by 2050 
To this end , Uganda is of no exception because we have continuously 
witnessed the extreme weather events such as the landslides , and floods.  
In other ecosystem s, drought is escalating , leading to frequent bouts of 
famine. These experiences of both the extreme and the slow onset climatic 
impacts are increasingly eroding the natural ecosystem services that society 
has been endowed with from generation to generation .

 Madam President 
We come to Madrid with hope and determination to engag e constructively 
in the current negotiations towards a desired outcome and the desire to 
transform conceptual discussions and technical work to real concrete and 
implementable actions to avoid the severity of events as proffered to in the 
special 1.5 repor t 
In contrast we see various sticky issues that will undermine our effort in 
coming up with a successful outcome in Madrid. 
Madam President 
Under your able leadership and guidance, Uganda looks forward to a 
favourable, and balanced outcome of these elemen ts; with the main focus on 
implementation , procedural or otherwise to foster implementation of 
concrete actions on the ground . 
In this regard the following decisions are critical to us: 
Raising Ambition: 
Raising ambition is critical and I applaud you madam President for all the 
effort that we limit temperature raise to well below 2°C. The best available 
science tells us that greenhouse gas emissions need to peak by 2020 and 
decline thereafter. This will be more practical if nature based solutions that 
contr ibute, 30% of the global climate solution receive considerable attention 
at this COP. 
Finance:  
It is critical that climate finance remains high on the agenda in this COP.  
As a country, we have a tireless effort to progressively implementing our 
NDC, with a costed NDC Implementation Plan already in place. The 
immediate NDC actions have been ela borated and incrementally being 
implemented albeit with challenges of access to means of implementation . 4 
 Government of Uganda has also estimated its finance needs for 
implementation of the National Climate Change Policy and Nationally 
Determined Contributions estimated at approximately 6 billion dollars . 
On adaptation, finance s o far, the country has formulated and defined the 
strategic investment plans to build r esilience and enhance adaptation. 
However accessing the much -needed financing to ensure such projects are 
implemented remains a challenge.  
Madam President 
The extreme events, which I have highlighted above, place a spotlight 
on loss and damage caused by climate change, 
The Warsaw International Mechanism of loss and damage associated with 
climate change impacts was established under the UNFCCC , to promot e the 
implementation of approaches to address loss and damage. 
To this end, consideration of the Loss and Damage is critical and the refore 
the need to finalise the WIM 
On Markets: 
We welcome the significant progress made over the years , on all major 
issues related to Article 6. However as we final ise the rules for markets and 
non market mechanisms , we call the need to maintain environmental 
integrity, ensure adaptation mechanisms are an intergral part of article 6 and 
move beyond pure offsetting of emissions and deliver overall mitigation in 
global emissio ns, avoid double counting, not allow the carryover of pre -2020 
Kyoto units to the Paris Agreement or other accounting loopholes, and 
deliver a share of proceeds from the market mechanisms for the Adaptation 
Fund 
Madam President 
That notwithstanding, my del egation looks forward to seeing a balanced 
treatment of the mitigation and adaptation issues in the draft decision s and 
conclusions to be proposed in Madrid . 5 
 Finally, I would like to assure you of Uganda’s commitment to working 
closely with the Presidency and the Chile Government during the remaining 
days of this conference to ensure a successful and balanced outcome in this 
COP . 
 
I thank you , Madam President
