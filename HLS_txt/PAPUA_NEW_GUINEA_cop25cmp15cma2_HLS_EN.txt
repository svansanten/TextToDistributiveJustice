Mr. President,
On behalf of my Prime Minister, Honorable James Marape, and the people of Papua New Guinea, I would like to thank the host Government and the people of the Kingdom of Spain for the warm hospitality during the Twenty-Fifth Session of Conference of Parties (COP 25). We also congratulate and reaffirm our support to the Chilean Presidency of COP 25 – the Blue COP.
Mr. President,
The establishment of the Rule Book is fundamentally important to us all. However, the Rule Book must not become a complex and difficult barrier that prevents easy access to the support needed to deliver mitigation and adaptation efforts nationally and globally to combat climate change.
We must be realistic about our national inventories on mitigation and greenhouse gas emissions, as such - Papua New Guinea has made serious commitment through these efforts by submitting its first Biennial Updated Report (BUR1) and its REDD+ Annex earlier this year which is one of our milestone achievements under the climate change agreement. Our plan is to revise our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) before end of 2020 and

start preparation on our Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) for 2024.
Mr. President,
Climate Finance for the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) implementation is very important. Finance is a critical tool for implementation of country NDCs and overall climate action to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the Convention and for ambition to stay below the 1.5-degree trajectory by 2030.
Predictable and expedited financial flows from both public and private sources at domestic and international levels are required to implement the NDCs and National Adaptation Plans (NAPS).
Mr. President,
The integrity and credibility of all our efforts – both developed and developing countries alike - requires consistency in the application of rules and methodologies that support reductions in emissions in a compliance regime.
Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries are expected to provide developing states with financial and logistical support to address climate change. Pacific nations bear little historical responsibility for climate change but are disproportionately affected by the impacts. Papua New Guinea is the first victim of climate change when we lost Carteret Island by the rise of sea level.
For this reason, Papua New Guinea would like to see that the application of rules and methodologies are closely aligned to our Social Integrity that includes Human Rights which we strongly believe is the important basis for ensuring environmental integrity, as well as addressing the rights of our people.
Mr. President,
Papua New Guinea, aligns itself with likeminded parties and groups to support and ensure that a share of proceeds (SOP) to accrue from all projects and activities in both Article 6.2 and 6.4. to go towards the Adaptation Fund, and the role of finance in the implementation of Article 6 on Markets and Non-Markets amongst the other operational articles is highly important. This is

integral to our overall efforts to cut emissions in the various carbon intensive sectors nationally, and in turn contribute to reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.
Mr. President,
Papua New Guinea’s environmental legislative framework is innovative and dynamic. It guides our domestic action to promote a climate resilient agenda as we move towards achieving economy-wide reductions. Papua New Guinea has the third largest tropical rainforest in the world and as a responsible global citizen, we are committed to conserving our rainforests, which is one of the largest lungs of the earth and integral to reducing carbon emissions as global carbon sink that saves lives. Papua New Guinea is committed to the promotion of clean energy as we transit into a low carbon pathway which is one of the tracks in our Nature Based Solution Initiatives announced in United Nation General Assembly in New York recently.
Mr. President,
We thank our development partners including the United Nations and financial contributors for their valued partnership in building national and regional capacity, financing climate agenda, transfer of environmentally friendly technologies and strengthening our resilience against climate change. We pledge to build on these foundations. We welcome new development partners and together we can pioneer innovative solutions to combat climate change while ensuring sustainable development.
Mr. President,
To conclude, we must be sincere to our commitments and make that paradigm shift from just talking to real tangible actions on addressing our common climate change challenge.
On this note you can count on Papua New Guinea’s commitments to lower carbon footprints and to work closely with all parties to address climate change.
Thank you, Mr. President.
