Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen.
I bring very warm greetings from the Government and People of the Federation of St. Kitts
and Nevis.
Let me take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to the Government and people of
Poland for the excellent arrangements and their kind hospitality as they host us during this
COP19.
St. Kitts and Nevis associates itself with the statements made by Fiji on behalf of the Group
of 77 and China, and the Republic of Nauru, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States.
Mr. President, another COP has been marked with the tragedy of natural disaster. The
Federation extends sincere sympathy to the people of the Philippines, Palau, Micronesia and
other countries that have been affected by the extreme impacts of Typhoon Haiyan. This
event has helped to put into context the importance of the task at hand here in Warsaw.
St. Kitts and Nevis numbers among those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate
change. We have a population of fewer than 50,000 people and a landmass of 105 square
miles, with the majority of settlements based on the coasts. We are particularly concerned
about the present and future implications for health, infrastructure, water security, and food
and nutrition security.
Mr. President, climate change is the greatest global challenge of our time. It is of significant
concern to us that while we continue to negotiate a global agreement, emissions continue to
rise to record levels. St. Kitts and Nevis joins other small island developing states, in calling
for urgent and ambitious action.
This year we received yet another important report from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). “The Physical Science Basis Report” underscores the gravity of the
challenges we face. It declares:
“Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all
components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and
sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.”
Let us be guided by the science.
Mr. President, there is a clear understanding that the stakes have risen and that the global
community needs to pool its collective will to galvanize the necessary action to address this
challenge. It is also clear to us that the solution rests in multilateralism. Our effectiveness
here in the UNFCCC process is a true test of its continued validity. I say to you, as states, we
all have a role to play.
Mr. President, it is in keeping with this view that the Federation calls for the inclusion of the
Republic of China (Taiwan) in the UNFCCC process as an observer.
Taiwan has shown its commitment to contributing to the fight against climate change through
its national actions as well as through initiatives to assist parties in reducing emissions, for
example, through clean energy projects. Taiwan is also one of the few countries to have
voluntarily announced reduction targets for carbon dioxide emissions.
Mr. President, we are at a critical point in these negotiations. It is evident that the will of a
number of parties is diminishing. I can confidently declare that this is not the case for St.
Kitts and Nevis, and other forward looking parties.
Extensive work remains to be done in creating a clear, balanced and feasible path to
achieving a legally binding agreement in 2015. We need to increase ambition and scale up
financing.
We appeal for the urgent operationalization and capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund.
Financing for the Adaptation Fund must also be addressed. Progress in these areas, will
greatly contribute towards important support for adaptation and mitigation actions into the
future.
We call for support of the AOSIS proposal under ADP Workstream 2, as it represents an
important tool in urgently addressing the pre-2020 mitigation ambitions gap, with initial
focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Parties should rise to the occasion to advance the issue of Loss and Damage. This relates to
the effects of climate change that cannot be addressed through adaptation or mitigation. The
mandate we received in Doha must not be ignored. Let us move forward in addressing the
institutional arrangements and financial support.
Mr. President, we call for successful outcomes on these issues here in Warsaw. We have too
much at stake. The survival of the way of life, livelihoods, prospects and progress of our
peoples, and future generations depend on us. Let us not fail where it is essential for us to
succeed.
Thank your Mr. President.
