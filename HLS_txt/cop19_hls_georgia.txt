It is a great honor and pleasure for me to be here. On behalf of the Government of Georgia, I
would like to thank the government of Poland and people of Poland for hosting the
Nineteenth Conference of the Parties of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Georgia is a small country; yet, it has shown itself to be committed to taking positive steps
towards global efforts against climate change. It is the outline of our common future, a future
that we share, no matter from which part of the world and which walk of life we come. It is
up to each and every one of us how we address the challenges, deal with needs and embrace
opportunities. It depends on us how we do it individually and as a part of the international
community.

Georgia is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Disasters caused by  natural  hazards are 
characterized by  high extensiveness, frequency and risk level. Floods, flash floods,  landslides, 
mudflows, snow avalanches,  heavy  rains, storm  winds, droughts,  etc. substantially affect the 
national economy.  
Hence, adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change is a priority for the Government
of Georgia.
Due to economic collapse in the past, GeorgiaÂ’s GHG emissions have decreased from 50 to 13
million tons of CO2eq. However, with future economic growth emissions will increase.
Georgia is determined to grow its economy through the low-emission path. As such, we have
started working on a Low Emission Development Strategy, and the identification of
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions.
The second development with the potential to become a success story is the Covenant of
Mayors. In Georgia, so far municipalities of seven cities have signed the Covenant of Mayors
and took the responsibility to reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2020. These seven cities,
being the largest cities of our country, represent half of our total population.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
There is a lot of ongoing discussions on the transformational impact, environmental
integrity, the role of cities, the need to link adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction
- we need to translate them into actions, we need to make them happen.
Let me conclude by expressing my hope that this conference will foster closer relationships
and stronger cooperation amongst the government, business, academia and civil society with 
a renewed and strengthened commitment to combat climate change.
Let me assure you that Georgia will be a reliable partner in jointly addressing the global
challenges and creating preconditions for climate friendly and sustainable development.
Thank you for your kind attention!
