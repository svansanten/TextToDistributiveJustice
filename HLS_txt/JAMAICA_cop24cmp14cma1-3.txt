 President, Excellencies, Distinguished delegates 
On behalf of the Government and People of Jamaica I take this opportunity to 
thank the Government and People of the Republic of Poland for the warm 
welcome and hospitality the delegation of Jamaica has experienced since we 
arrived in this beautiful city of Katowice. 
Let me also thank the Presidencies of the COP 23 and 24 and the UNFCCC 
Secretariat for the excell ent organization of the work throughout the two weeks, 
the result of which we are certain will be a strong Implementation Framework for 
the operationalization of the Paris Agreement. 
In this regard, Jamaica associates fully with statements made by the Alliance of 
Small Island States and the Group of 77 &China, throughout this conference. 
Jamaica welcomes the IPCC special report on warming of 1.5°C which has been 
described as a game ch anger and can be considered the most important report 
to have emerged from the IPCC process since its inception in the late 1980’s. 
Mr Chair, for us in Jamaica and the entire Caribbean Region, it would be hard to 
imagine what life would be like in a world with 2 or 3 -degree increase, or worse. 
The reality is that a temperature rise of 1°C has already had an adverse impact 
on our people, and our economies, and the natural resources which sustain them 
both. 
In that light, Jamaica is striving to step up our own ambition consistent with the 
long -term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, and is working with the 
NDC Partnership towards an enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions 
under the Paris Agreement by 2020 as the primary tool for delivering mitigation 3 
 ambition. Importantly, we are committed to pursuing greater ambition despite 
contributing less than 0.05% to the global emissions. 
Mr Chair, at the recently concluded G20 Leaders Summit, the Most Honorab le 
Andrew Holness, Prime Minister of Jamaica reminded us that Small Island 
Developing States do not have the luxury of engaging in a philosophical debate 
on Climate Change. 
We are on the front lines. 
Every year without fail, one or more of the islands in the Caribbean Region is hit 
by a severe weather event. In recent times, these events are of greater frequency 
and intensity and are significantly depleting national economies. 
It is in this context that all Parties at this 24th Session of the Conference of Parties to 
the United Nations must join hands with the Small Island Developing States and 
support the strengthening of a global system that further secures a commitment 
to the 1.5 °C target, and the commitment to finance its achievement. 
Mr Chair, the P rime Minister of Jamaica recently accepted the UN Secretary 
General’s invitation to provide political leadership and Co -Chair with French 
President Macron , the UN Climate Change Financing Initiative in support of 
implementing the objectives of the Climate Summit in 2019 
We are heartened by the signal of increased financial commitment that have 
been announced by many Parties at this conference, during the past days and 4 
 expect that other Parties will come forward with timely pledges so that we can 
deliver on the longstanding commitment to mobilize the agreed US$100 billion per 
annum by 2020. 
Mr Chair, Jamaica holds itself out as a small island developing state that has 
embraced fiscal responsibility and energy diversity. 
Our government believes in progressio n towards a low carbon future. In 2016, the 
largest wind energy facility in the English -speaking Caribbean, Wigton Windfarm 
Limited, completed its Phase III by installing twenty -four megawatts (24MW) of 
wind energy. This brought the wind farm's total capa city to 62.7 MW after 
previously installing 20.7 megawatts in 2004 and eighteen megawatts (18MW) in 
2010. This is currently a government owned facility. 
In addition to the commitment of the Government of Jamaica, the private sector 
is also "crowded” in as a significant partner into our goal for greater ambition. 
There are several privately owned hydro power plants across the island which 
total more than twenty megawatts (20MW). Also, one company has launched 
commercial operations installing Jamaica’s first utility -scale grid -connected solar 
PV plant in 2016. The solar plant comprises of twenty megawatts (20MW) of 
installed capacity with the ability to power more than 20,000 households over the 
next 20 years. This was no simple feat with more than ninety -one thousand two 
hundred (91,200) panels connected. 5 
 To extend further Mr Chair, in that same year, another company developed the 
largest private -sector renewable energy project in Jamaica installing 36.6MW of 
electricity to the national grid. This is equivalen t to providing power for twenty -five 
thousand (25,000) customers, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 
approximately sixty -six thousand (66,000) tons of CO 2 equivalent per year. 
Mr Chair, Jamaica aims to reach fifty per cent (50%) renewable energy by 2030 
which would reduce our need to import fossil fuels as we pay close attention to 
matters related to climate change. 
Recently, and to further demonstrate leadership and total commitment to our 
energy transformation, we installed a fifteen kilowatts (1 5kW) solar electric system 
on the Office of the Prime Minister, which will result in a sharp reduction in the 
government’s electricity bill. 
Renewable energy is certainly at the foremost of our thoughts and action. 
Mr Chair, these are significant achievem ents and goals for any small island and 
we look forward to doing even more as these activities provide , among other 
things , employment and infrastructural development benefits to our country. The 
communities surrounding these projects also experienced rele vant co -benefits to 
support their abilities to be more resilient. 
On adaptation, this is necessary for our very survival. Much work has been done 
in adaptation thus far, from strengthening our policy and planning frameworks to 
work across various sectors o f society and in communities. However, the evidence 6 
 is clear: we have a far way to go, even as the global emissions continue to trend 
upward as shown in the recent U N Environment’s Emissions Gap Report, and the 
consequent effects worsen. 
We encourage Part ies to increase support for adaptation to vulnerable countries 
such as Jamaica and other Small Island Developing States, and to take this into 
account in the guidance for adaptation communications, and the further work 
to be undertaken by the Adaptation Co mmittee and the Least Developed 
Countries Expert Group. 
Despite our efforts at adaptation, these gains could easily be reversed with the 
direct hit of a single hurricane. These rapid onset events happen even as we 
struggle to understand and cope with the true impact of slow onset ones, 
including sea level rise, ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity and salin ization. 
Jamaica supports the establishment of a work programme under the SBSTA that 
will assess how adaptation efforts in developing countries ha ve been funded 
since the entry into force of the Convention. Such a work programme has taken 
greater importance based on the recent IPCC special report on the impact of 
temperature rise of 1.5°C and will inform recommendations on how to better 
address the needs and concerns of developing countries. 
There are limits to adaptation which we must acknowledge and take into 
account across the spectrum of work of the Paris Agreement. This year , we 
celebrate the five year anniversary of the Warsaw International M echanism and 7 
 we are heartened by the advances made, but much more need to be done and 
we look forward to the outputs of future work in the five-year rolling work plan on 
loss and damage. 
We also acknowledge the work of the Task Force on Displacement which has 
produced work highlighting the real consequences of climate change relating to 
forced migration, a real issue for island states where coastal lands are being lost. 
Mr Chair, we belie ve that the Talanoa Dialogue is an excellent framework for 
implementing the IPCC Report, contribute effectively to raising ambition and 
reduce emissions so as to prevent warming from exceeding 1.5°C. We call on all 
Parties to demonstrate the political will necessary to make this happen and 
translate the Talanoa Dialogue into scaled -down, implementable actions on the 
ground which will lead to increased ambition. 
Mr Chair , the task here in Katowice seem s daunting but they are not 
insurmountable. We need a ren ewed focus in furtherance of previously agreed 
outcomes to get us back on track to effectively address climate change .  
Parties have an obligation at COP 24 to the citizens of the world and we must 
show that the international community is still capable of coming together to solve 
any difficult problem. 
Mr Chair, we must move from Climate Talk, to Climate Action. 8 
 We do hop e that the outcomes of COP 24 will result in the full and effective 
operationalisation of the Paris Agreement. Indeed the world is watching and 
waiting and we cannot disappoint. 
Mr President, excellencies, distinguished delegates, I thank you .
