It is my pleasure to participate in this important international event and an honour to address this meeting of the COP20 and CMP10 as a representative of the Government of the Republic of South Sudan, delegated by my Minister – Hon. Deng Deng Hoc Yai, Minister of Environment.
Allow me to please convey greetings from president Gen. Salva Kiir Mayardid and the people of South Sudan. I acknowledge the participation of States’ Party Members and the important stakeholders all over the world to the COP20 and PMC10. Appreciations to the participation of the South Sudan delagates here this week which signifies our collective interest, energies and commitment towards not only seeing the end of climate change emergencies, but even more importantly, we are vesting our hope in realising a vison of improvement on climate change, that will hopefully lead to peaceful and vibrant International, regional and national economic developement.
Once again, thanks to the Government and the people of the Republic of Peru for the warm wecome and presidented hospitality. The UNFCC Secretariat and the Platform for bringing us together. Behind this gathering I atrongly belied is a dedicated effort and work is taking a different direction; By and large, we must thank you for keeping the momentum on ending drought, address REDD + issues and the general climare change emergencies in accordance to Kyoto protocol modalities.

Distiguished Guests, Ladies and Gentelmen; on the behalf of the Government of the Republic of South Sudan, the people and the Minister of environmnet who due to many reasons has not been able to attend; accept please our apology for arriving late to this meeting of international importance, which is due mainly to logistical problem. In fact, I started my journey on Thursday December 4th but only to arrive on the 9th instant. Though late, the government of the Republic of South Sudan would like to show soliderity with UN and to express commitment to the support of the Member States in standing with us not only in resolving both regional and internal conflicts, but making effeort for South Sudan to become a party member to the UNFCC particularly and other UN MEAS.
Dear Distiguished Guests,
South Sudan has acceded a number of MEAS and protocols such as the RAMAR on Biodiversity, The Ozone, REED + conventions and others. It is working to wards ractifying and or acceding the UNFCC and other protocols as soon as conditions will allow; though given the situation at hand, facing financial difficulties to carry out enabling activity and subsequent problem to meeting compliance. I kindly Urge and would like to remind the LCD group in particular that the financial and the technical issues raised and discussed in Bangkok during the last Minamata Convention Meeting were cruicially indicative of same experiences facing the progress on other conventions including the UNFCC convention.
Climate Change effects are now a reality. For example this year, Sotuh Sudan experienced some basic defferences in rain fall pattern which is higher than two to three decate or more ago! Here desertification recked the entire sub- saharan – region. Physically affecting both environmental and huan fabrics and creating a wide spreaded insecurity, economic desparity and health hazards. Witnessed by displacement of an estimated population of about 13M people by 2010/11 in Africa alone. In the low temperate regions, ice melting caued seas and ocean rising. Making life difficult too.
During the last IGAD meeting in Nairobi, we were remineded by the quotation from Albert Einstein, paraphased who said:
‘The significant problems we face today cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.”
Your Excellencies, Distiguished delegates, Ladies and Gentelmen; This simply means humans have to re-think the course of action and change strategic planning modules. Unity for cause in climate change is important in which South Sudan as a new nation, needs cooperation and support to gaining knowledge and strength more than many may be.

At the Summit in September 2011, it was said surprisinglythat drought for example arrives at our doors after months of warnings. But “the disaster is how inappropriate investment for example has made communities vulnerable to drought, eroded their capacity to cope for resilience.”
Acknowledging this is what should give us the enegy to rethinking remodling our strategies, our way of doing things so that we can rise above limitations, to get a different and better outcome for the future of the future generations.
Distiguished and Invited Guests, Ladies and Gentelmen,
The urgency is perhaps even more emphasized by the regional and global climate chage crises that have unravelled particularly the mother earth so much in our times.
On top of the impacts of climate change, we have suffered global shocks in experiencing contious insecurity due to the fact that resounce are becomming scurse and life expensive.
Contextually Dear Delegates,
The key highlights of our country - the Republic of South Sudan report includes some work on few national enabling activities for UNFCCC in particular and other few MEAS financed by Geff. The national action plan proposals were made to the Steering Committee.
Allow me Your Excellencies to state that although South Suda is under going a difficult trasition, yet this will not abstract us from commiting and dedicating our efforts for the general wellfare of the global community. We therefore take this opportunity to present those issues of strategic importance proposed for action by the government:
 Our most important commitment was to once again unwaveringly affirm the fundamental right to freedom from hunger for all our citizens by addressing climate change and other pressing environmental issues.
 We also committed to taking a disaster risk reduction approach to long-term investment, address the root causes of vulnerability to drought and build resilience, qualify both climatic and economic improvement pograms.
 Ambeciously plan with the help of UN, to plant 1m trees across the county to curve desrtication.

 Recognising climate change, the transboundary, international and regional impacts of its consequences, we committed to universal and united plan of action. Fore exmple in 2006/7 we had a transboundary memorundum of unerstanding with Uganda on natural resources along the borders in five transboundary Protected areas- taking into consideration water, whildlife and forestry aspect.
 Within the Nairobi Strategy during UNEA too, Member States acknowledged the broader impacts of climate change, citing the growing impact of more frequent and severe floods, deforestation in addition to general climate change matters.
 We also reflect on the commitments to the global Member States, the commitments of support of our development partners. That sooner, South Sudan will acceding the UNFCC convention. But there is need to finance the enabling activies.
Distiguished and Invited Guests, Ladies and Gentelmen
Before closing, there are three important things we need to express here:
 We applaud the fellow Member States and development partners that South Sudan stands to gain support and to learn from you.
 Finally and most importantly, I wish to affirm the political will and commitment of the Government of the Republic of South Sudan to particularly support the UNFCC and CMP secretariats’ initiatives. South Sudan will tirelessly work in cooperation, coordination and collaboration with the UN agencies and all stakeholders to UNFCCC.
Thank you.
