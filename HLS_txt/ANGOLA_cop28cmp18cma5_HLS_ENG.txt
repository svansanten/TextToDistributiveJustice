Dear Delegates, 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen. 
 
It is with the greatest honor that I address the different delegations present at this 28th Conference 
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and I would like 
to ex press our thanks to the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the welcome they 
accorded to me since our arrival in this city of Dubai. 
 
Given the excellent working conditions put forth to the holding of this event, I would like to 
highlight the very s pecial relevance it assumes, as it is an occasion in which we will carry out the 
First Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement, within which we will try to take stock of the impact 
of the policies that we have implemented jointly and individually as countr ies, with the aim of 
achieving the objective of mitigating the serious consequences of climate change that have ravaged 
our planet. 
 
It is clear that as a result of the effects of these changes, mainly the populations of our countries, 
the regions to whic h each one of us belongs and the world in a broader sense, are, among others, 
the segment most affected by climate change, especially because there is a very harmful impact of 
this process on people's daily lives, their productive activity, their mobility and, in short, their 
quality of life. 
 
Excellencies, 
 
The issue of clima te change is part of the key priorities in all sustainable development programs 
and strategies that we outline in the Republic of Angola, which we consider a critical concern and 
therefore deserves special attention, always with the aim of strengthening our resilience, given the 
effects of these changes, which have already seriously affected the Angolan people in their daily 
lives, threatened to a large extent by the risk of destruction of the ecosystems of different species 
in some regions of our country. 
 
We face all issues relating to climate change with great firmness and commitment, and on this 
matter, we do not compromise on any effort to contribute to global action aimed at environmental 
preservation, which is reflected in the National Strategy for Climate Change 2022 – 2035, which 
includes initiatives and visions aligned with the African Union's 2063 Agenda and the United 
Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. 
 
In view of the afore -going , I want to highlight the practical actions of the Republic of Angola, 
among which I underscore our commitment to renewabl e energy, which repres ents one of the main 
pillars of mitigation to climate change and constitutes, on our own initiative, a decisive step in the 
energy transition process. 
 
We are committed to changing the national energy matrix, prioritizing clean energy production 
sources with the construction of hydroelectric plants and photovoltaic par ks, which means that 
more than 65% of the current 6,400 MW of energy produced in the country now comes from 
sources ecologically recommended as they are environmentally friendly. 
 
With the ongoing program to extend the national energy transmission network from the main 
production sources located in the lower Kwanza basin to the eastern and southern provinces of the 
country, our ambition for the next four ye ars is to discontinue the use of thermal power plants that 
still power some parts of the national territory, which will represent not only a large financial 
saving but also a great environmental benefit with the significant reduction in the burning of foss il 
fuels in the generation of electrical energy. 
 
The Republic of Angola is building new and expanding old hydroelectric dams, which have 
provided the country with a significant increase in its electrical energy production capacity and 
generated a surplus that can meet the needs of SADC neighbouring countries, especially with the 
completion of the hydroelectric development of Caculo Cabaça and the beginning of works on the 
national project of the Baynes hydroelectric dam on the Cunene river, for Angola and Namibia. 
 
within the context of the efforts we have undertaken to significantly increase our renewable energy 
production capacity, we have been paying very special attention to the implementation of 
photovoltaic projects in some areas of our country, re sulting in a huge reduction in annual 
consumption of diesel and, consequently, contributing to mitigating the effects of pollution while 
we meet the energy needs of the populations of these locations. 
 
Still in this field, I want to emphasize other projects, of which I highlight the production of green 
hydrogen and its derivatives at the same time that we have been preparing and organizing ourselves 
to embark on the path of oil production with low carbon and methane emissions as our contribution 
to the fight against the increase in global temperatures, which affects our planet. 
 
Angola has been a victim of the phenomenon of severe drought in the south of the country, with 
devastating effects on the lives of populations and animal life. This phenomenon that occurs 
cyclically in the south of Angola and in other parts of our planet, shows us all that it is important 
to act to prevent catastrophes of varying dimensions in the future, with measures to reduce the 
emission of greenhouse gases, to ensure a more habitable and safe planet for future generations. 
 
Due to the consequences of climate change, Angola had to seek urgent endogenous solutions to 
save entire populati ons from the effects of drought by investing large millions of dollars in the 
construction of a 165 Km Canal in the Cafu region, in the Province of Cunene, an infrastructure 
that made it possible to solve the serious problem that existed in that region, and helped to create 
at the same time factors that favoured the emergence of conditions that did not previously exist for 
the deve lopment of household farming, which in turn influenced the improvement of the nutritional 
situation, with beneficial effects on public health and the well -being of Angolans in that location. 
 
Two other larger projects, Ndue and Calucuve, are being built in the same province, and the 
construction of six other large water retention dams is planned in the province of Namibe, all 
within the scope of the broad program to combat the effects of the drought in southern Angola, the 
most affected region in the country. 
 
We are developing, with national and foreign environmental organizations, an ambitious 
environmental education program aimed mainly at children, pupils, students and young people in 
general. With the same organizations, we are working with some success on the project to plant 
millions of mangrove seedlings for the recovery and preservation of mangroves along the vast 
Angolan Sea coast. 
 
In this fight against the harmful consequences of climate change, we have counted on the support 
of important international partners with whom we have worked to develop a system to support 
warning information about this phenomenon in the Angolan region to which I mentioned, so that 
not only to prevent ourselves more effectively against these problems, but also to define a 
combination of different solutions that are considered the most appropriate. 
Excellencies, 
 
As part of the broad measures that the Angolan Government has been taking to improve all the 
mechanisms within its reach, with the aim of playing an important role in the context of global 
efforts to preserve environment, it is part of the National Space Strategy of Angola for the years 
2016 -2025, the initiative that consists of observing the earth using the satellite that will be placed 
in orbit in the near future, in order to serve as another tool that will enable the detection and 
mapping of oil spills at sea, to provide data on deforestation and illegal logging areas, monitoring 
compliance with environmental standards in mining activities, also including a technological 
solution designed to support monitoring the compliance with the indicators of the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals. 
 
In this context, I want to highlight the fact that we consider it important that a roadmap is defined 
at this C OP in which the steps to be taken should be established, so that the commitments made at 
COP 26 in Glasgow are hono ured, amongst which the goal of doubling the financing adaptation 
measures by 2025. 
 
I think that when setting a new climate financing objective for the period after 2025, a whole set 
of factors will have to be taken into account that do not weaken or slow down the economies of 
developing countries, which are not capable of giving up from one moment to the next on natural 
resources, namely oil , as the main source of income on which they considerably rely, to ensure 
their survival, their economic and social development . 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that Angola has submitted to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, in 2015, its first national contribution to the reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions and I emphasize that we will keep the goal with the same 
determination of achieving a 35% reductio n in gas emissions by 2030 meet the ne cessary funding 
for this purpose. 
 
On the side -lines of this Climate Summit, Angola will join the initiatives of the United Nations 
and other specialized international organizations, on the decarbonization of the oil and gas industry 
and on the ne ed to measure and reduce emissions of polluting gases such as carbon dioxide and 
methane gas, with ambitious targets as part of humanity's battle against climate change. 
 
Excellencies, 
 
The Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of Af rican, Car ibbean and 
Pacific States “OACPS ” held in Luanda in December last year, during which I took over the 
Chairmanship of the organization, underlies the responsibility of OACPS to look after their 
interests and take care of their concerns, with a focus, among others, on issues relating to climate 
change, taking into account that a good number of the countries that make up the group ing are 
particularly exposed to this phenomenon and the serious consequences that derive from it, such as 
the frightening rise in ocean and sea levels, which threatens to make some Pacific and Caribbean 
islands disappear from the map.  
 
I, therefore, want to place a very special emphasis on the importance that the issue of financial 
resources allocated to the climate assu mes for the countries of these three regions of the world and, 
for this reason, I would like to high light the fact that the need during this COP 28, the framework 
for a new agreement for the financing necessary to carry out programs at a global level, wit hin the 
scope of climate action, is established. 
 
We are pleased that the Loss and Damage Fund was finally approved at this COP28, due to the 
great relevance it has for this group of countries that are among the most vulnerable in the world 
to the impacts of climate change. 
 
I also want to emphasize that in seeking to express the general feeling of the Organization of 
African, Caribbean , and Pacific States, OACPS, that COP 28, in formulating a new financia l 
architecture for the climate we should consider climate justice as one of its most solid pillars . We 
highlight the need to fulfill the repeated promises of financial contributions and access to financing 
under favorable conditio ns for less industrialized, less developed countries, with emphasis on 
small island states most threatened by harmful environmental phenomena resulting from climate 
change. 
 
I believe that the growing sensitivity of the people and nations of the world to i ssues related to the 
climate, can lead to this COP 28 reinforcing the importance of solidarity among all, so that the 
goals recommended both at this COP and in previous ones be faced with more commitment and 
more determination, in order to achieve them wit hin the deadlines that we have been setting for 
ourselves . 
 
Thank you for your attention!
