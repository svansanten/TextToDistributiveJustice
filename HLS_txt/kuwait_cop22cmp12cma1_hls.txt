At the outset, I am pleased to extend to my brother, His Majesty King
Mohammad VI, and to the Government and people of the sisterly Kingdom
of Morocco, my sincere thanks and gratitude, for the warm welcome and
generous hospitality we have received, as well as for the distinguished
preparation for this meeting. I would like also to congratulate His
Excellency, Mr. Salaheddine Mezouar, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation, of the sisterly Kingdom of Morocco, on his election as
President of this Conference.

Coming a few days after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, our
meeting today on this important international occasion, with such
prestigious level of participation; is proof of His Majestyâ€™s concern to
achieve what we aspire for, in addressing the phenomenon of climate
change in a diligent manner, and realizing the magnitude of the challenges
faced by our planet and its environment, reflect our earnest pursuit to
reform the climate system and protect our planet and its environment, until
it regains its natural balance.

Your Majesties, Excellencies and Highnesses,
Reiterating its commitment to join in supporting the efforts exerted by the
United Nations to combat the phenomenon of climate change, my country 
Kuwait has participated effectively and constantly in the negotiations 
aiming to limit the negative impact of this phenomenon, 
based upon the principles
and provisions and the implementation of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, and the subsequent provisions until the
Paris Agreement, since they constitute the legally binding instruments and
the basis of joint cooperation, while taking into consideration, the disparity
in shouldering the burden, the inequalities in capacities and the levels of
sustainable development in the developing nations.

Your Majesties, Excellencies and Highnesses,

In abiding by its international commitments, my country Kuwait, has
voluntarily put well-studied plans, based on scientific and economic
research, within its available possibilities, to rehabilitate its oil installations,
as its oil sector seeks to adopt a new strategy, founded on scientific and
economic grounds, that aim to limit emissions, in addition to establishing
mechanisms to improve energy efficiency, without jeopardizing its
essential interests and its commitments to developing clean industry, while
taking into consideration how to take advantage of the programs and the
mechanisms established in the Framework of the Agreement.

Furthermore, the State of Kuwait is voluntarily seeking to introduce
renewable energy resources in its development plans, to ensure a
sustainable supply of energy for future generations, and as part of its
contribution to limiting the emissions of green house gases into the
atmosphere, as well as joining in the efforts of the international community
to protect the climate system for present and future generations.

In this context, | would like to assure you that we are about to complete the
constitutional procedures for the ratification of the Paris Agreement on
climate change.

Your Majesties, Excellencies and Highnesses;
With much hope, we look forward to see the global consciousness and awareness
that we have sensed in the cooperation to limit the effects of climate change,
reflect on the Marrakesh Conference, to consitute a 
turning point in addressing the impact of that phenomenon, and work
towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, through the adoption
of resolutions for the phase preceding 2020 and beyond, in view of the
amendments introduced and approved at the Doha Conference and to
implement the items of the Paris Agreement.

My country Kuwait, also hopes that the developed countries will adhere to
their pioneering role in reducing emissions, and assisting the developing
countries, by making resources available to finance the transfer of
technology, building capacities, as well as adapting to the negative effects
resulting from climate change, and the negative effects arising from the
response measures to reduce the impact of climate change, particularly the
countries whose economies depend on the production and export of fossil
fuels, as their main and only income.

In conclusion, I thank you all again, and wish our Conference all the
success.

The Peace, Mercy, and Blessings of Allah be upon you.
