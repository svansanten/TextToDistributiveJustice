  The U.S. has led the way in the relief effort just as we typically do. In
the past 10 years, the U.S. has contributed $30 billion out of a worldwide
total of $90 billion in humanitarian assistance for disasters of all kinds.
  Of course, scientists dont know that climate change produced Typhoon
Haiyan, but it is just the kind of thing we can expect more of in a world
where our climate is rapidly changing and it reminds us that the
corresponding impacts have the potential to be fundamentally disruptive
to our world and the world we hope to leave to our children and
grandchildren.
  It is for this reason that President Obama and the U.S. government are
hard at work to help solve our shared climate challenge.
  Last June, President Obama announced the U.S. Climate Action Plan to
address climate change at home and abroad.
  We have issued important draft regulations on carbon pollution from
new power plants in the United States, and are hard at work developing
regulations that will cover existing power plants as well.
  President Obama has also issued landmark rules for vehicles. Fuel
efficiency standards for cars and light trucks are doubling from 27 miles
per gallon to over 54 miles per gallon over the space of about a dozen
years. A strengthening of standards is also in the works for heavy-duty
vehicles.
  These are large-scale efforts, with power and transportation together
accounting for about two-thirds of total U.S. energy emissions.


  Having doubled renewable energy production in the Presidents first
term, were doubling it again between now and 2020, and were ramping
up even further our substantial energy efficiency efforts.
  All in all, were making good progress toward meeting our commitment
to reduce emissions in the range of 17 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels.
  The U.S. also continues to play an important role in climate finance,
increasing our assistance to $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2013 and
convening donor countries to develop coordinated strategies to meeting
the $100 billion long-term finance goal.
•  Simultaneously, we are fully engaged in crafting a new international
climate agreement for the post-2020 period that is ambitious, effective,
and durable. We have advocated a structure for the new agreement that
is designed to attract the participation of all countries.
•  This kind of structure, based on a spectrum of mitigation commitments,
self-differentiated across the broad range of evolving national
circumstances and capabilities, and in this way consistent with the
principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective
capabilities, is the only kind that we can see producing the ambitious,
inclusive agreement we need.
•  By contrast, an agreement based on 1992 categories that are unchanging
will not work. There are options here. If those categories are to be
operational in character  in other words, determine who has what kind
of obligations and responsibilities  they must evolve to reflect changing
circumstances. Alternatively, they can remain unchanged if they are not
operational. But they cannot be both operational and unchanging.
•  Our meeting here in Warsaw can help build momentum towards Lima
and Paris, especially if we are willing to leave ideology at the door and
remain committed to the Durban mandate.

•  And as we work overtime in the UNFCCC, we must also expand the
field of international cooperation to include complementary initiatives
that can make tangible progress right now to address the key drivers of
greenhouse gas emissions. Thats why we have been pushing hard,
together with partners including the EU, Mexico, Canada and island
states, for practical action through the Montreal Protocol to phase down
hydrofluorocarbons. This alone has the potential to avoid some 90
gigatons of emissions by 2050.
•  Let us work together, mindful of our mutual responsibilities to each
other, our own citizens, and the global community.
