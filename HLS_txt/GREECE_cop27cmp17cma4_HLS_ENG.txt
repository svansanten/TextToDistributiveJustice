Excellencies, dear Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

We meet during an acute energy crisis—sparked by Russia’s unprovoked war on Ukraine.
| want to Speak to you as q “radical realist.”

Radical because | really believe in the energy transition.

It is imperative. Unavoidable.

The energy transition is not just about mitigating risk.

It is an pportunity. And it is a Strategic necessity.

Low-carbon energy means energy Security—this much is clear.

But the energy transition will also allow us to reconceptualize Greece's economic model.
For decades, we have been a net energy importer.

Our trade balances and our competitiveness Suffered.

This is changing.
