National statement COP 22 Norway 
Minister of Climate and Environment 
Vidar Helgesen 
 
Mr. President, Excellensies, Indigenous Peoples delegations, 
Excellenc ies, Ladies and Gentlemen. 
The Paris Agreement and it's entry into force are historic achievement . 
While celebrating it, our focus must be on implementing . 
Climate change is accelerating. 
Impacts are seen all over the globe. In the Arcic, glaciers are melting at 
record pace. In all regions, ecosystems and local communities are at 
risk. We must redouble our efforts to support the most vulnerable 
amongst us in adapt ing to the impacts of climate change. 
 
Accelereating the transformation to low emission societies through 
deep emission cuts is the most efficient way to reduce impacts. 
The low emission transformation is getting up to speed . The renewable 
energy and electric vehicle revolution are example s of that. These 
revolutions can't be reversed.

Reducing deforestation can provide one -third of the emission 
reductions needed to stay on a below two-degree pathway . We have 
seen g ood results in REDD+ -actions in Braz il, Guyana and Colombia, 
and important progress in Indonesia, Peru and DR Kongo. 
Norway has committed to significant REDD + financing . Our climate 
and forest initiative will continue at present high level until 2020 and 
be extended to 2030.  
Mr. President. Besides the impact of forests to combating climate 
change, forests are key to t he wider achievement of the SDGs, on food, 
water, economic development and human rights. 
Norway is deeply committed to the Paris Agreement and international 
climate cooperation 
We are strengthen ing our domestic climate action plan for 2020 and 
will deliver a long term low emission development plan well before 
2020 , and we have set aggressive targets for 2020 . 
We will work to make the Paris Agreement grow in strength and take 
us to a climate neutral future. 
The world needs to stand together to do the job. Thank you!
