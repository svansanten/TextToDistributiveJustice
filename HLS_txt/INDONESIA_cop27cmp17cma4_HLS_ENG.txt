 Excellencies, 
 
1. The world is currently facing the triple 
planetary crisis ... climate change … 
pollution … and biodiversity loss . 
 
→ These three are interrelated and very urgent 
to overcome. 
 
2. Amidst such crisis… there is no other choice… 
but to cooperate.  
 
3. Paradigm of collaboration must be put 
forward . 
 
4. Allow me to share three things. 
 
5. First, COP -27 in Egypt must be the COP of 
implementation . 
 
6. One year after Glasgow… there has been no 
significant global progress. 
 
7. For this reason, COP -27 must be used … 
 
→ not only to enhance ambition, but also 
implementation … 
 
 → including the fulfillment of support from 
developed to developing countries. 
 
8. Second, we all must be part of the solution … 
 
9. Every country must contribute… in accordance 
with their respective capacit ies… 
 
→ with the spirit of burden -sharing instead of 
burden -shifting 
 
→ more capable countries should support and 
empower the other countries. 
 
10. Third, Indonesia continues its efforts to lead by 
example.  
 
11. Two months ago, we have submitted 
Enhanced Nationally Determined 
Contribution (Enhanced NDC) 
 
→ which consists of the enhanced target of 
Indonesia’s emission reductions … 
 
→ to 31,89% with its own capacity, and … 
 
→ 43,20% with international support.  
 
 12. Such increase is coherent with significant 
progress of our policies, including among 
others … 
 
→ expansion of nature conservation and 
restoration , 
 
→ implementation of carbon tax, 
 
→ achiev ing FOLU Net Sink 2030, 
 
→ development of electric vehicle 
environment, and 
 
→ initiation of biodiesel B40 program 
 
13. To ensure the financing of energy transition … 
 
→ Indonesia has launched the Country 
Platform for Energy Transition 
Mechanism.  
 
14. All of these national efforts … need to be 
complemented by clear international 
supports… 
 
→ including the establishment of an effective, 
and equitable carbon market,  
5 
 
→ investment for energy transition, 
 
→ and financing for climate action. 
 
15. As the G20 Presidency , Indonesia continues to 
push for green recovery … as well as strong and 
inclusive climate action. 
 
16. In the future, through the ASEAN 
Chairmanship in 2023 … 
 
→ Indonesia will continue to pay attention to 
strengthen ing climate action. 
 
Excellencies, 
 
17. We must take concrete actions… and 
strengthen collaboration based on dialogue 
and trust, 
 
→ to create a better and more sustainable 
world. 
 
Thank you .
