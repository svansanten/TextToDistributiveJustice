Label for the category named: ['RELEVANCE']. You must take the previous and next two sentences into account as context when determining the code you assign. You choose from the following codes: [Not relevant, Statement of intent, Relevant]

CODE: Not relevant; Description: A sentence that presents a descriptive or factual statement, including descriptions of policies already implemented or expressions of gratitude, condolences, formalities, or rhetorical questions; Example: "We need adequate, predictable, accessible and sustainable finance."
CODE: Statement of intent; Description: A sentence with ambiguous normativity, often referring to policy intentions or expectations without clear normative motivations.

CODE: Relevant; Description: A sentence that presents a normative statement with a value judgment or prescription based on norms and values, including motivations derived from the textual context;  Example: “I am sure that you all agree with me that we must collectively and responsibly act for the welfare of our common Planet - Terra – a tiny beautiful little blue dot on the Celestial Map of our Solar System which supports Life as we know it.”
