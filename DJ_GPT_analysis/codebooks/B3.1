"You are tasked to annotate sentences from speeches presented at the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties. It is your task to identify by what Distributive Justice principle is foundational to the normative statements.
Label for the category named: ['PRINCIPLE']. You choose from the following codes: [general normative statement, egalitarian, utilitarian, prioritarian, sufficientarian, libertarian].

CODE: not evaluated; Description:A sentence that does not present a normative statement, presenting a descriptive or factual statement, including descriptions of policies already implemented or expressions of gratitude, condolences, formalities, or rhetorical questions; OR A sentence with ambiguous normativity, often referring to policy intentions or expectations without clear normative motivations. These sentences prescribe an action or behaviour but lack explicit normative justification; Example: "We need adequate, predictable, accessible and sustainable finance."
CODE: general normative statement; Description: A sentence that presents no indication of foundational distributive justice principle that is used as a motivation for the normative statement; Example: "There must be a common framework for regular reporting and tracking so that we know where we are headed; in addition to processes for reviewing and enhancing commitments, as well as for ensuring accountability and compliance."
CODE: egalitarian; Description: A sentence presenting an egalitarian motivation. Motivated by the goal to reduce inequalities and have equality of opportunity. This includes statements the highlight the inclusion of all and references to mutual contributions by all. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is also seen as egalitarian; Example: "It is critical to develop common fair and transparent rules for carbon pricing measurement and ensure their multilateral recognition and comparability between countries."
CODE: utilitarian; Description: A sentence presenting a utilitarian motivation. Motivated by the goal of maximizing the benefit of all or contributing to ‘the greater good’. The benefit of all can be in present and future generations. Found in sentences prescribing the need to take action, motivated by the need to improve the lives of all; Example: "We must activate all our efforts to preserve the environment for future generations, and related to it I would like to thank to all those who, despite the many obstacles and difficulties, continue in these efforts."
CODE: prioritarian; Description: A sentence presenting a prioritarian motivation. Motivated by the moral obligation to help the worst off. Highlighted in sentences focussing on supporting vulnerable developing countries. It does not focus existing differences; Example: "Furthermore, where adaptation is not an option, countries must have support for irreparable loss and damage"
CODE: sufficientarian; Description: A sentence presenting a sufficientarian motivation. Motivated by the idea that everyone should be able to reach a common level of well-being. Found in sentences referring to a global standard of well-being that everyone should reach as well as statements implying that no one should be left behind this threshold; Example: "The longer we wait, the more it will cost; more victims will suffer from our inaction and the greatest weight will fall on the most vulnerable, the poorest peoples and future generations: what is at issue here is respect for their fundamental human rights."
CODE: libertarian; Description: A sentence presenting a libertarian motivation. Motivated by a need for freedom, indicating minimal government involvement and focus on free markets.
