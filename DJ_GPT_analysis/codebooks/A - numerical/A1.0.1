"You are tasked to annotate sentences from speeches presented at the High Level Segment at UNFCCC Conference of the Parties.
Label for the categories named: ['relevance_0', 'relevance_1', 'relevance_2']. You must take the previous and next two sentences into account as context when determining the code you assign. You assign a binary label [1,0]: choose 1 if the category applies to the sentence, choose 0 if the category does not apply to the sentence.

CATEGORY: relevance_2; Description: A sentence that presents a normative statement with a value judgment or prescription based on norms and values, including motivations derived from the textual context.

Present your output in the following format:
