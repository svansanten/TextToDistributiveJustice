*TU Delft Masterthesis: Towards Just Policy Evaluation - unravelling Distributive Justice Principles in a Global Climate Policy Context*

DJ_GPT analysis contains all documents used for sentence annotation with GPT-4o. 2 files are used for the automated text annotation:
gpt_annotate_num - for numerical labels
gpt_annotate_string - for string labels

These files are adapted versions of [gpt_annotated](https://github.com/npangakis/gpt_annotate)
*To run both files: include your OpenAI eky in gpt_api_key.txt*


**Directories**
- codebooks
  The codebooks created during manual annotation, formatted to function as GPT prompt. Codebooks are based on string labels and created for four tasks. 
  - B1 Classification for relevance 
    - .0 No example (zero-shot) (Also available as numerical codebook; A1.0)
    - .1 1 example (one-shot)
      - .0 No context instruction
      - .1 instruction to take context into account
  - B2 Classification for principle (relevant sentences)
    - .0 No example (zero-shot)
    - .1 1 example (one-shot)
  - B3 Classification for principle (all sentences)
    - .0 No example (zero-shot)
    - .1 1 example (one-shot)
      - .0 No context instruction
      - .1 instruction to take context into account
  - B4 Principle, Topic, Unit Shape
    - .0 All sentences
    - .1 Relevant sentences
- data
  - manually annotated datasets, split into test and train set
