Dear Delegates, We are witnessing hard times : it is undeniable that instead of going forward we are unfortunately going backwards. Our societies are proving incap able -or unwilling - to find real solutions to climate change. It is true that several international crisis jeopard ised our efforts in this regard, from Covid - 19 to the aggression of Ukraine, just to name a few. Yes, keeping 1.5Â° degrees alive and within reach sometimes seems an impossible goal, but it has never been more important. I t truly must become a national priority for all of us, no one excluded. In the last years, San Marino decide d to become an ope n-air laboratory for innovation, in order to attract new pro jects to tackle climate change o n a small scale. We call once again on other small MINISTRY FOR TERRITORY AND ENVIRONMENT, AGRICOLTURE, CIVIL PROTECTION AND RELATIONS WITH THE AUTONOMOUS PUBLIC WORKS STATE CORPORATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO Vicolo del Macello, 2 - 47890 Repubblica di San Marino Info.territorio@gov.sm - www. territorio.sm T +378 (0549) 882470 F +378 (0549) 885265 states and Parties to join eff orts to implement common initiatives that would otherwise be beyond their reach. My country also decided to focus on sustainable housin g. We are proud to recall that last October the Republic of San Marino hosted the 83rd meeting of the United Nations Economic C ommission for Europe (UNECE) Committee on Urban Development, Housin g and Territorial Development. We are even more proud to announce that t his meeting resulte d in the San Marino Declaration, a document enshrin ing valuable principles for more sustaina ble, fair and inclusive urbanisation. With the valuable support of United Nations Economic C ommission for Europe (UNECE), 75 more trees have been plant ed in San Marino. It may s eem little effort, but in our tiny territory, every small step is meaningful in order to help mitigate the negative impacts of climate change, as well as to continue the transition to wards renewables energies and more sustainab le business model s. Dear friends, In times like these, w e must work together to find solutions that will help us overcome global climate challenges. We owe it to future generations but also to ourselves, as leaders, to our memory and to what we want to be remembered for. Thank you for your attention.
