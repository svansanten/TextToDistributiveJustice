We need all hands on deck. Parties, cities, the pri vate sector and civil society must work together. To develop the solution s that will drive the green transition. This is why Denmark and key partners introduced the new initiative; P4G. We hope this global alliance will become a new driv er for green growth. We firmly believe that those who help lead the gree n transition will not only respond to one of today’s biggest global challenges. In addition, they will prosper. Simply from being ahead of the curve. Denmark has set strong goals. We aim to cover at le ast 50 pct. of our final energy consumption from green energy in 2030. And t o become independent of fossil fuels by 2050. As a self-governing part of Denmark, the Faroe Isla nds have independent climate goals. By 2030, green energy sources will p ower all electricity in the Faroe Islands. And by 2025, green energy will heat at least 50 pct. of all households. Since 1990, Denmark has cut its emissions by more t han 30 pct. Kept its energy use constant. And still succeeded in increas ing our GDP with 44 pct. This is the result of a persistent energy policy. A nd the result of a focus on cost-efficient solutions and promoting private sect or investment. It is not a compromise - it is a win-win situation. We will focus on these solutions at the Clean Energy Ministerial next year in Copenhagen. A strong implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda is not only a necessity - it is also a great opportuni ty. It is an opportunity for more resilient and sustainable societies. And for g rowth and job creation. Now is the time to act. Thank you.
