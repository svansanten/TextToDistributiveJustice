11 December 2018 Statement at the high -level segment delivered by Elisabeth Köstinger and Miguel Arias Cañete on behalf of the European Union and its Member States *** Check against delivery *** Elisabeth Köstinger, Minister for Sustainability and Tourism, Austria President, Excellencies, Distinguished guests, Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to make this statement on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. It is now 3 years since the historic adoption of the Paris Agreement. COP21 will always be remembered as the moment when Parties came together to make an unprecedented collective commitment to tackle climate change. In Paris we made a promise to the world, on which we need to deliver with our joint efforts here in Katowice. Recent extreme weather events and new scientific evidence provided by the IPCC Special Report on 1.5° degrees have once again underscored the need for urgent action. Here in Katowice we have the task and the responsibility to fulfill the global commitment made in Paris by finalising the detailed rules and guideli nes for implementing the Paris Agreement ‘work programme ’. C l o s i n g S t a t e m e n t o n b e h a l f o f t h e E u r o p e a n U n i o n a n d i t s M e m b e r S t a t e s A u s t r i a n P r e s i d e n c y o f t h e C o u n c i l o f t h e E u r o p e a n U n i o n Adopting a robust, operational work programme consistent with the Paris spirit is crucial for putting the Agreement into practice and being able to track the progress by all Parties towards our lon g-term goals. This is the EU’s top priority for COP24, as it should be for all Parties. The rulebook must be ambitious, clear and comprehensive, covering mitigation and adaptation, transparency, means of implementation and finance flows. At the same time, it must also be tailored and contain in -built flexibilities, taking into account, in line with the spirit and letter of the Paris Agreement, different starting points and capacities of individual countries. In addition to the a comprehensive and balanced rulebook, we should leave Katowice with a strong outcome from the Talanoa Dialogue, sending a signal that we are taking the science of the IPCC Special Report very seriously and that we are determined to act, by preparing long -term greenhouse gas emissions strategies and informing the preparations and updates of NDCs by 2020. We should aim not for the lowest common denominator, but for the strongest possible outcome, renewing our commitment to Paris. The outcome of COP 24 should be reflective of the urgency of the climate challenge and our collective responsibility for this one planet that is our home. The EU remains committed to the collective goal of developed countries to mobilise 100 billion dollars a year by 2020 and through to 2025, from a variety of sources, to finance climate action in developing countries. In 2017 alone, the EU and its Member States contributed a total 20.4 billion euro in climate finance – which is well over 40% of the total provided by developed countries. The Presiding Officers and the Polish COP 24 Presidency have our full support for guiding the negotiations on the rulebook in the decisive next days. W e remain confident that by working together in the spirit of multilateralism we will manage to deliver on our collective promise to the world and to present and future generations - to protect our planet from climate change. C l o s i n g S t a t e m e n t o n b e h a l f o f t h e E u r o p e a n U n i o n a n d i t s M e m b e r S t a t e s A u s t r i a n P r e s i d e n c y o f t h e C o u n c i l o f t h e E u r o p e a n U n i o n Miguel Arias Ca ñete, Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, European Commission President, Excellencies, Distinguished guests, Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, We came to Katowice with one main objective – to adopt an ambitious, clear and comprehensive work programme for implementing the Paris Agreement. At the same time the EU has actively engaged in the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue and participated in the various events under the Global Climate Action Agenda. The EU has spared no effort in delivering on our climate objectives and turning the Paris pledge into real action and concrete results. The EU is on cou rse to exceed its 2020 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 20%: by 2017, we had already reduced emissions by 22% from 1990 levels, while our economy grew by 58%. Building on our 2 020 target we have already adopted EU -wide policies to meet our Paris pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030. In fact, when the agreed EU legislation is fully implemented, total greenhouse gas emission reductions are estimated to reach around 45% by 2030. Just a few days ago the European Commiss ion presented also its strategic long -term vision for a modern, competitive and climate neutral economy by 2050. It shows how Europe can lea d the way to climate neutrality by investing into realistic technological solutions, empowering citizens, and aligning action in key sector – while ensuring social fairness for a just transition. The Commission proposal will now kick-start an EU -wide debate among policy - makers, stakeholder and citizens, which should allow the EU to submit a long -term strategy to the UNFCCC by 2020. For our global efforts to remain credible in view of latest reports and evidence, all Parties must be prepared to develop a longer -term vision. Just earlier today we have participated in the crucial Talanoa dialogue political phase and we heard inspiring reflections by Parties and non -state actors on how do we get there. This process should now trigger a serious reflection on the adequacy of ambition and the prep aration of long -term strategies, ahead of a UN Climate Summit next year.

In addition, the EU and its Member States have announced substantial fcontributions to the Adaptation Fund at this COP. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, We urge all Parties to engage constructively in the coming days in order to overcome remaining differences and to deliver the Paris Agreement Work Programme.
