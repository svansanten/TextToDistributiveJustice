1/2 GOVERNMENT PRINCIPALITY OF LIECHTENSTEIN National Statement Principality of Liechtenstein Minister Dominique Gantenbein COP 23 16. November 2017 Fiji/Bonn Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen First, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the people and Governments of Fiji and Germany for their warm and welcoming hospitality and this prime example of cooperation between nations. The Paris Agreement demands joining forces. All of us, small or large state alike, must make efforts based on national capacities. This process demands our leadership. It challenges us as a team. To be successful, we can and must go through the four phases of a thriving team process: Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing. Forming: With the Paris Agreement we formed a common strategy for the future. Storming: In order to achieve our common goal, we must deal honestly and transparently with the following question: 2/2 How can we take the different interests into account? This is exactly what we are doing here at COP23 and we have to stand united and show the world, that this is not a step backwards, but an important process for the next big joint step towards the future. Norming: The process of implementation has begun. We must act today and collaborate in addressing climate change. Therefore, we need to develop a common set of rules to operationalise the Paris Agreement. This is the goal for COP 24. Performing: We have to ensure the environmental integrity of the rule set being applicable for all parties. We are eager to work on a draft text based on the work done here at COP 23 as a basis for finalisation and decision making at COP 24. If we succeed in translating the results of this COP in its complexity to concrete actions, then we will succeed in achieving our goal. I am pleased to announce that Liechtenstein ratified the Paris Agreement in September and I can assure you that we will continue our commitment and contributions in the working process. As Minister for Home Affairs, Education and Environment, I daily see how strongly climate change affects other topics than the environment. In the area of Home Affairs, it is already visible that various areas of life are nowadays affected by climate warming and therefore, new challenges evolve in the areas of civil protection, economic and infrastructural security. As Minister for Education I am aware, that we bear responsibility for the future of our children and childrenÂ’s children. So slowly, but steadily we have to transform into a sustainable and renewable society. Ladies and Gentlemen, our planet needs our collective effort! The time for change is now! Vinaka! Vielen Dank! Thank you!
