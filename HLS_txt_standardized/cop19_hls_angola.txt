Your Excellency President of COP 19 Excellencies, Distinguished Heads of Delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen Allow me on behalf of the Government of Angola and His Excellency the President and Chief of the Executive greet the people and Government of the Republic of Poland and congratulate the warm welcome we received as well as the excellent conditions created for the realization of this important conference where we all deposit expectations, concrete answers, challenges and opportunities. Likewise we congratulate the Secretariat of the Convention and all the organizers who seek to bring together the various approaches about our climate future. We commend the work done, with particular attention to the integrated global challenges at a time when we are facing numerous and severe impacts caused by extreme weather events. We express our solidarity with our sister people of the Philippines due to death and destruction caused by the Haiyan typhoon as well as all others who have been aggressively affected by the negative impacts of the unpredictable global climate phenomenonÂ’s which we are witnessing. Your Excellencies, Angola has been affected by a prolonged drought for more than 3 years particular in the province of Cunene in the south of the country which has caused considerable economic and social losses and directly affected an estimated 500,000 people. Land degradation has accelerated to 7% of the territory in the last four years, which means that the government has had adopt unpredictable budgets and integrated investments to respond to the needs of the population that live depend agriculture. Ladies and gentlemen, The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, its principles, mechanisms and main instruments which having been discussed for climate stability and emissions reduction, continue to be valid and the dialogue that we are adopting is helping to address some of our problems. However, we have to be more transparent to promote capacity building and technology transfer as well as the support and solidarity, as the right response for developing countries to build and participate in global sustainability. Our dialogue for the future, grounded on the Durban Platform and other initiatives aimed at reaching a new Global Agreement is gradually taking its first steps towards building a consensus, however climate sustainability requires from all governments the acknowledgment of the close relationship between integrated and inclusive sustainable development and attention to climate change. We are finding that ambition for mitigation is not enough; we need ambition also in increased funding, adaptation, technology transfer, capacity building and other aspects. For this reason we think that we should have in articulate in Warsaw the basis to conduct the work to develop the agreement that we want to adopt in 2015. (2) Your Excellencies, The socio-economic development of African countries is inextricably linked to our ability to meet the challenges of adaptation but on the other hand without funding for adaptation we will not achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves in our national plans and programmes which are based on equity, solidarity and common perspectives. Even though we have registered progress with the implementation of the Convention, the temperature continues to rise and the effects of climate change are felt increasingly in economies that are expected to stabilize. The major emitters must increasingly participate mainly because the principle of common but differentiated responsibility must be increasingly accepted and be regarded as a gain for future generations. We note with concern that the biggest polluters continue to increase their emissions and between 1990 and 2008 these increased by about 8 % and there is need for their participation to establish more a just global economy based on cooperation and equilibrium. The Cancun agreement is insufficient and the impact is ever more visible in the economies of many African countries which have a low adaptive capacity, difficulties in financing, poverty and numerous problems to adjust policies to guarantee sustainable development and meet the millennium development goals. Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen Within the framework of the Convention, Angola with their national circumstances and programs have sought to contribute to the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases. (3) We are building our economic growth, with direct benefits in various sectors, we are also promoting the improvement of the living conditions of our citizens dedicating 35 % of the national budget to the social sector, as these are factors which contribute to the unity and national cohesion, essential elements for political stability and well being. Fighting hunger and poverty is our greatest challenge. In so doing we integrate the reduction of emissions according to national circumstances in different sectors. Our energy matrix is being diversified through low carbon structural projects as part of our low carbon strategy. We have selected for this first phase 59 projects eligible to emission reduction initiatives such as the Clean Development Mechanism. Regrettably, we note with concern that the carbon price continues to decline in the international markets, meaning that there is little incentive for governments and their development partners, including the business sector, to invest in low carbon projects. With the aim of promoting dialogue and actions to mobilize financial and technical resources for the African continent at this juncture, Angola will host the Africa Carbon Forum 2014 in Angola to promote extensive, to mobilize resources for the clean development mechanism to support the mitigation actions with sustainable development. At the national level we are promoting the development and the implementation of various programs such as housing, sanitation, sustainable land management, water for all, reforestation, recovery of agricultural production, integrated environmental management, environmental education as well as the national strategies for waste management and persistent organic pollutants, and it is important to note that in the last ten years we have reduced the levels of extreme poverty from 67% to 36.6%. We strive to combine the fight against poverty with improvements in environmental quality including through emission controls in conformity with a sustainable economy. (4) Despite all these efforts, we recognize that much more remains to be done. The challenges of Angola after 11 years of peace continue. On 11 th of November this year Angola celebrated 38 years of independence from 500 years of colonization and decades of conflict. In the context of climate change negotiations, we believe that the developed countries should voluntarily cooperate technically and promote the exchange of experiences in mitigation and adaption to consolidate our national adaptation plans and deepen knowledge. We reaffirm that Africa as the least emitting continent, prioritizes adaptation. We recognize that we are experiencing a period of economic crisis, however the capitalization of the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, are the only means to translate the implementation of the Convention into mitigation and adaptation actions. We expect that the Warsaw Conference of the Parties adopts a clear calendar with activities and concrete results that demonstrate our increasing commitments to re-launch of financing, mitigation, technology transfer, adaptation and capacity building in accordance with the spirit of the Durban Platform. ( 5 ) We take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the Secretary General of the United Nations for his efforts and visible appeals which has been promoting justice and striving for consensus for a global commitment and we welcome his initiative to host a Summit of Heads of State on Climate Change in 2014. Together we can build a more prosperous world that respects human life. Thank you.
