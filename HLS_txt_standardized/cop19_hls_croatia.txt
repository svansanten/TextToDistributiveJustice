1 STATEMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA to the Nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC Ninth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol Warsaw, Poland, 11-22 November 2013 Presented by MARIJA  ĆULAC DOMAC, M.Sc. ASSISTANT MINISTER MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURE PROTECTION 2 - Check against delivery - Mr President, Excellences, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and gentlemen, It is my great pleasure and honour to convey the warmest thanks to the Government and the people of Poland, for hosting these prominent Conferences in their beautiful country. − It is my pleasure also to be here and represent Croatia // − Let me start by pointing out that Republic of Croatia strongly supports the goal to define legally binding agreements that aim to ensure climate adaptation measures.// − Parties covered by the amendment to the Kyoto Protocol cannot by themselves ensure the keeping of global temperature increase to 2°C, and therefore quick global action is necessary to reduce emissions in order to avoid consequences arising from warming of the Earth // − Legally binding documents are daily guidance for us, legislators to keep us focused on achieving the noble goal to create and preserve sustainable living environment for generations to come// − Croatia, like many countries worldwide but particularly similar as other Central European and Mediterranean countries, is faced with various challenges // − All under the spotlight of the main priority  how to transform our economies in order to encourage so much needed  growth and new jobs // − However, we must never leave out of sight how important it is for our future to ensure 3 the economic growth in such a balanc ed way that it goes hand in hand with environmental protection.// − Because this is the essence of what we do and why  to preserve natural resources for future generations not only in Croatia but also globally // − And this truly is a problem of us all, all our countries, big and small, developed and developing.// − We all need to take leading global scientists in the area of climate change research as constant reminder that we, people, are the main cause of global warming // − They have called on us to turn to green energy sources and to reduce fossil fuel consumption And we need to respond to that call // − We need to think about It da ily and strive to introduce new, green, more efficient, environmentally friendly technologies. // − Yes, this will engage more of everything, More funds, more creativity, more efforts.// − But there is no other option. // − And thats why if there are no standards globally binding for all, we are faced with less readiness to implement adequate measures, to invest in technologies and innova tions which in the end has a global impact. It hurts quality of life globally and locally. // − Mr President, 4 − In this regard Croatia has already undertaken steps to fight greenhouse emissions // − We have developed Strategic framework aiming to green development, environmental protection, efficient and sustainable utilization of natural resources and efficient management in all segments of economy. // − Future commitments for all countries should be based on objective criteria such as total emission per inhabitant and per sector, GDP, reduction potential, reduction costs and others which countries will point out during negotiations and which should reflect national circumstances in which the states will first accept the ag reement, ratify it and then implement the assumed commitments // − Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, − This is never an easy task, and in every country as much as in Croatia it calls for a very determinant governance and very strong collaboration between sectors, both governmental and with various industries. // − This also calls for public support so much needed to commercialize green industries. // − Mr President, distinguished delegates, − I hope that in the course of these Co nferences, with our joint efforts, we will develop quality decisions by which a long-term reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will be achieved and our joint goal, the protection of global climate, that is, will be successfully achieved. − Thank you.
