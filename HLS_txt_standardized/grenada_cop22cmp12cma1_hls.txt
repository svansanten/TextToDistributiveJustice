believe that our role here in Marrakech is to consolidate and build on this sense of urgency. In this regard, we are concerned at the slow ratification of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and urge all parties that have not done so to ratify as soon as possible We also believe that we have to redouble our efforts to complete the rules and modalities for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and we look forward to many of the implementation tasks being completed during 2017. Mr. President Small island developing states like ourselves are already experiencing climate change impacts and want to respond as a matter of urgency. In Grenada, we have started significant work at home but need resources and technical assistance to implement our plans. We have submitted our Nationally Determined Contributions and we have initiated adaptation responses at the national and community levels consistent with our draft National Adaptation Plan. We have ensured that these are all in line with national development priorities, as expressed in our 2030 national sustainable development plan. It is therefore very important for us, that we make progress on climate finance here in Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance. We also look forward to participating in the initiatives and deliverables under the Action Agenda, especially on matters relating to energy, water, livelihood and infrastructure. Mr. President Despite these initiatives at the national level, we note that no one country can solve the problem of climate change. It requires a united global effort, sustained over a long period of time. It is important therefore that we continue to work as a united global community and keep the spirit of multilateralism alive. We have to ensure that we continue building on the spirit of Paris, for the benefit of our entire global community. I thank you.
