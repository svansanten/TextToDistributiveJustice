1 Your Highness, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Emir of Dubai, Heads of State and Government, Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, President of COP -28, Mr. Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is an honor to be here today at the Twenty -Eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention o n Climate Change in the city of Dubai. I would like to express our gratitude for the warm welcome and generous hospitality we have received in this host country. Guinea -Bissau acknowledges the importance of this global gathering to discuss and adopt measur es to address the effects of the climate crisis affecting every corner of our planet. Like many countries in West Africa, Guinea -Bissau is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Our coastal communities are subject to rising sea levels, our agricultural crops face increasingly unpredictable weather conditions, and our biodiversity is constantly under threat. However, despite being victims of climate change, we are also active participants in seeking solutions. We have taken significant actions to strengt hen our resilience and adaptability. This includes the implementation of sustainable management strategies for our natural resources, the promotion of clean and renewable energies, and the adaptation of critical infrastructure to withstand climate impacts. Biodiversity conservation is a top priority for us. Our country is blessed with a rich diversity of species and unique ecosystems, and we are committed to protecting them for future generations. We believe that biodiversity is intrinsically linked to our nation's resilience. This commitment is reflected in designating over 26% of our territory as protected areas, surpassing Aichi Target 11 of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and aligning closely with the Global Biodiversity Framework, whose plan includes specific measures to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, including safeguarding 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030. 2 Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of international solidarity. Ladies and Gentlemen, As the President of the Afri can Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), it is my duty to highlight that climate change threatens the progress made in the fight against this endemic disease. By 2030, it is estimated that between 147 and 171 million people will be at risk of contracting malar ia in Africa. Women and children are the primary victims of the adverse effects of climate change. Ladies and Gentlemen, All these issues underscore that the climate crisis is a global threat that requires a global response. No country should be left behin d, and it is crucial that developed nations fulfill their financial and technical assistance obligations to help developing countries face the challenges of climate change. Speaking of financial resources, we reiterate the need for new and additional funds to support adaptation and mitigation of climate change in developing countries. These resources are crucial to ensure that we can implement the necessary measures to address this crisis. Regarding the issue of climate -related losses and damages, we call f or a more robust and equitable approach. The most vulnerable communities cannot be left alone to face the devastating consequences of extreme weather events and natural disasters. We reaffirm our commitment to the Paris Agreement and the construction of a new climate regime based on justice and equity. However, it is essential that we take a comprehensive global assessment of our progress so far. Time is running out, and decisive action is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. In this sp irit, Guinea -Bissau is committed to working in cooperation with all countries present at this conference. Together, we can chart a path and adopt appropriate measures for a more sustainable, resilient, and just future for all nations and future generations, with the aim of protecting our planet. Thank you!
