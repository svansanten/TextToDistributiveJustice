COP National Statement Australia Mr President Climate change is real and we must collectively take strong and effective global action to deal with it. That is why the task of negotiating a new global climate change agreement by 2015 is so important. An agreement that would establish for the first time from 2020 a common platform for all countries to take serious coordinated global climate action that is economically and fiscally responsible. An agreement in which all major economies, and Australia’s key trading partners and competitors, play a real part in controlling their emissions through comparable real global action. In the meantime, Australia will unilaterally reduce its emissions by 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. Australia will review its climate change policy in 2015, considering further action and targets on the basis of comparable real global action, in particular by major economies and trading partners, and progress on the new agreement. To achieve this, a t home the Australian Government will implement a Direct Action Plan on climate change, to drive down Australia’s emissions. Australian business es, farmers and households will be provided with incentives to invest in technologies that will efficie ntly and effectively source low -cost abatement. This is a fundamentally better way to reduce emissions than through a carbon tax. Australia looks forward to working with the Polish Presidency here in Warsaw and over the coming year, and also with the Presidencies of Peru and France as we take steps towards adopting a new agreement at Paris in 2015. Thank you
