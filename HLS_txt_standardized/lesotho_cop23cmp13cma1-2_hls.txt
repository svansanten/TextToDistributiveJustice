1 STATEMENT BY H.E. M R. FRANCIS MOKOTO HLOAELE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND METEOROLOGY AT THE TWENTY THIRD SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES (COP23 ) TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTON ON CLIMATE CHANGE, THE THIRTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFEREN CE OF THE PARTIES SERVING AS THE MEETING OF THE PART IES TO THE KYOTO PROTOCOL (CMP13 ) AND THE SECOND SESSION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT (CMA1.2) BONN, GERMANY 6TH TO 17TH NOVEMBER, 201 7 2 Excelle ncies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen I have the h onour to congratulate The Right Honourable the Prime Minster of Fiji, His Excellency Frank Bainimarama, on his electi on as the President of COP 23, the CMP13, and 2nd CMA. I am confident that he will lead the COP process in an open, transparent and inclusiv e manner, including facilitat ing efforts to advance the work progra mme of the Paris Agreement in a balanced, fair and rule-based manner. To this end, I confirm my Country’s full cooperation and comm itment in reaching agreed outcome s under his leadership. Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen Lesot ho has in recent years experienced climate -related negative impacts which include d prolonged droughts, receding dam levels, drying rivers and wetlands, ju st to name a few. These adverse impacts have led to large economic losses, adversely impacting on food security. We look forward to the special report on 1.5oC by the IPCC, which should come early in 2018, so that its findings can be considered by the Facilitative Dialogue that will be held in 2018. Lesotho has recently developed climate change policy aimed at enabling it to manage, promote and implement climate change interventions. Our proposed 5-year n ational climate change strategy 3 outlines the need for Lesotho to radically transform its economy i n a climate resilient and sustainable manner. We therefore call upon the interested Parties to support us in the implementation of this policy. We support the Paris Agreement mandate of holding meetings every five years. We also support the issue of the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Ag reement. More funding will thus be available to tackle adaptation in the developing countries. We therefore urge the developed country Parties to offer more financial resources and provide a clear pathway to the projecte d US$100 billion finance that they agreed to provide by 2020. We also encourage simplified procedures for direct access to funding, to enable countries with little capacities such as Lesotho, to easily access these funds. We acknowledge the progress m ade in resp ect to adaptation. We therefore would like to see a scaled up adaptation finance. We urge the developed countries to provide full support to the developing count ries for the formulation, updating and implementation of Adaptation C ommunications, as a comp onent of NDCs, which will take into account information on the developing countries’ needs and associated costs, including support needed to implement adaptation action. 4 Finally, Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen Paris was a landma rk in our common pursuit of a safe and sustainable world. We do understand that a lot still has to be done in the coming years and decades, in order to implement and accomplish the full potential of the Paris Agreement. It is our collective responsibility to put the world on a path towards a climate -resilient sustainable future, without compromising the survival of nations. I thank you.
