1 Rear-Admiral (Ret’d) Hon. J.V. Bainimarama, CF (Mil), OSt.J, MSD, jssc, psc Prime Minister and Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Sugar Industry COP25 Statement on Behalf of Pacific Small Island Developing States _________________________________________________ Madrid Tues. 10 Dec., 2019 SPAIN 1100 Hours Bula vinaka. It is an honour to speak to you all today on behalf of all Pacific Small Island Developing States, or PSIDS. As a “Blue COP”, this is a fitting platform for those of us whose oceanic economies, our ecosystems, and our very existence are threatened by the climate crisis. But every nation in the world should recognise that the ocean is a vital, and too -often overlo oked, player in winning this fight for our lives; therefore, PSIDS support the proposal to better reflect this reality within the UNFCCC. 2 As nations on the front lines of devastating cyclones and catastrophic sea level rise, PSIDS are a bloc of States uni ted by a shared resolve to tackle the climate crisis with boldness and with ambition. This sense of ambition must carry us –– and the world –– forward as we prepare for COP26 in Glasgow. But that essential ambition is far off course, as our priorities here in Madrid have run into challenges that, much like the crisis itself, are man -made. The negotiations on market mechanisms must deliver robust rules and regulations that ensure environmental integrity, prevent double -counting, promote an overall mitigation of global emissions, and provide an avenue for more reliable resources to be used for rapid adaptation. Instead of taking ambitious steps forward, we’re seeing backwards attempts to re-write the Paris Agreement and bring in credits tha t have already been created under the Kyoto Protocol. 3 Further, the Pacific is concerned that humanity i s on the cusp of a terrifying scenario : the abandonment of science. While our climate change projects have to be science -driven and evidence -based in order to be approved, certain actors are happy to pay lip service and not meet the demands that well-established science has revealed. Worse still, others have put on blinders, and are denying the very existence of an immense we alth of information and science. Ladies and gentlemen, the world must adjust course to avert catastrophe. We must align our ND Cs to common, five -year timeframes, and we must agree on the governance modalities, procedures, and guidelines for carbon markets under Article 6 without delay. We must seek out new and innovative ways to address loss and damage, and PSIDS call for the establishment of a new financing window within the Green Climate Fund –– and a means for its implementation –– to do so. We must ensure we reach the $100 billion -dollar per year climate finance goal by 2020, and we must begin work on setting a new collective goal for climate finance for 2025 and beyond. 4 For the survival of PSIDS, and for the world, we must set a stage not of ignorance and denial –– but of ambition –– for COP26 and beyond.
