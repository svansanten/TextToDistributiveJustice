TDS High level segment remarks 11 ‐21 ‐13 1 High Level Segment Opening Statement  Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. Presiden t, Ministers, distinguished guests and colleagues, I'd like to start by extending our th oughts and prayers to the people of the Philippines.  The U.S. has led the way in the relief effort just as we typically do. In the past 10 years, the U.S. has contri buted $30 billion out of a worldwide total of $90 billion in huma nitarian assistance for disasters of all kinds.  Of course, scientists dont know that climat e change produced Typhoon Haiyan, but it is just the kind of thi ng we can expect more of in a world where our climate is rapidly changi ng and it reminds us that the corresponding impacts have the potent ial to be fundamentally disruptive to our world and the world we hope to leave to our children and grandchildren.  It is for this reason that Presiden t Obama and the U.S. government are hard at work to help solve our shared climate challenge.  Last June, President Obama announce d the U.S. Climate Action Plan to address climate change at home and abroad.  We have issued important draft regu lations on carbon pollution from new power plants in the United States, and are ha rd at work developing regulations that will cover existing power plants as well.  President Obama has also issued la ndmark rules for vehicles. Fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks are doubling from 27 miles per gallon to over 54 miles per gallo n over the space of about a dozen years. A strengthening of standards is also in the works for heavy-duty vehicles.  These are large-scale efforts, with power and transportation together accounting for about two-thirds of total U.S. energy emissions. TDS High level segment remarks 11 ‐21 ‐13 2  Having doubled renewable energy produ ction in the Presidents first term, were doubling it again betwee n now and 2020, and were ramping up even further our substantial energy efficiency efforts.  All in all, were making good progr ess toward meeting our commitment to reduce emissions in the range of 17 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels.  The U.S. also continues to play an important role in climate finance, increasing our assistance to $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2013 and convening donor countries to develop coordinated strategies to meeting the $100 billion long -term finance goal. • Simultaneously, we are fully engaged in crafting a ne w international climate agreement for the post-2020 period that is ambitious, effective, and durable. We have advocated a st ructure for the new agreement that is designed to attr act the participation of all countries. • This kind of structure, based on a spectrum of mitigation commitments, self-differentiated across the br oad range of evolving national circumstances and capabilities, and in this way consistent with the principle of common but differen tiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, is the only kind that we can see produ cing the ambitious, inclusive agreem ent we need. • By contrast, an agreement based on 1992 categories that are unchanging will not work. There are options he re. If those categories are to be operational in character  in other words, determ ine who has what kind of obligations and responsibilities  th ey must evolve to reflect changing circumstances. Alternatively, they ca n remain unchanged if they are not operational. But they cannot be both operational and unchanging. • Our meeting here in Warsaw can he lp build momentum towards Lima and Paris, especially if we are willing to leave ideology at the door and remain committed to the Durban mandate. TDS High level segment remarks 11 ‐21 ‐13 3 • And as we work overtime in the UN FCCC, we must also expand the field of international cooperation to include co mplementary initiatives that can make tangible pr ogress right now to address the key drivers of greenhouse gas emission s. Thats why we ha ve been pushing hard, together with partners including the EU, Mexico, Canada and island states, for practical action through th e Montreal Protocol to phase down hydrofluorocarbons. This alone ha s the potential to avoid some 90 gigatons of emissions by 2050. • Let us work together, mindful of our mutual responsibilities to each other, our own citizens, and the global community.
