HIGH LEVEL SEGMENT Check against Delivery Statement by H.E. Ms. Marlis Amann-Marxer Minister of the Environment, Liechtenstein Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to first take the opportunity to thank the people and the Government of Poland for their warm and welcoming hospi- tality over the past two weeks. Humanity is faced with a global challenge. That challenge re- quires global answers. Since we all are affected by the conse- quences of climate change we all have the responsibility to limit these consequences as far as possible. Liechtenstein is a very small country in the centre of the alps. It is situated between Switzerland and Austria. Only one third of the country allows settlements. Avalanches, landslides, rock fall and erosion threaten the other parts: We cannot escape. So it is also in our own interest to limit the consequences of cli- mate change wherever we can. Therefore, from a risk perspective, our situation is comparable to many other small countries being threatened by climate im- pacts. With respect to global challenges we are dependent on cooperation and solidarity. As a well-developed country - in this spirit of solidarity  we are ready to bear a fair part of any efforts made to fight climate change and its consequences with the aim to support sustainable development and green growth in less favourable regions of our globe. Taking up the challenge of climate change, the Liechtenstein Government has  continued its financial contribution within the climate finance framework;  signed up to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol until 2020;  Implemented a GHG reduction target of at least 20 % by 2020 based on 1990 levels in its national laws. In order to achieve the envisaged reduction target domestically the Government has passed an Energy Strategy that aims at increasing renewable energy production and energy efficiency. Moreover, from 2014 we decided to further increase our levies on CO2 and will implement further measures within the trans- portation sector. Mr. President, as you can see Liechtenstein has taken up the challenge of combatting climate change by all means. And we are ready to further engage in whatever is necessary to contribute to the ul- timate objectives of the Convention "to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system." Thank You!
