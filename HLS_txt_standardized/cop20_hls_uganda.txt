My delegation l ooks forward to concrete outcomes from this COP that will provide the necessary mome ntum for a final international climate agreement in Paris next year that is legally binding and comprehensive with bala nced and equitable treat ment of mitigation and adaptation. We want to express our deep apprecia tion to the out-going President of COP 19, H.E Marcin Korolec for the effective leadership that he provided. We also commit ourselves to working with you in delivering the expected outcomes of COP 20/CMP 10. Mr. President, 4 The adverse impacts of climate change are threatening the very survival of natural and human systems. Uganda has not been spared from these impacts. In the past deca de alone, the country has witnessed a myriad of disasters with the result ant loss of lives, property and destruction of infrastructure which have gr eatly affected the achievement of our national socio‐economic develop ment goals. Several of these episodes i n c l u d i n g m e l t i n g o f i c e c a p s on Mt.Ruwenzori, the 3rd h i g h e s t m o u n t a i n i n A f r i c a, a r e l i k e l y t o c a u s e serious consequenceson geo‐polit ical security and severe advers e impacts to millions of people. Our efforts in tackling these ch allenges are s e r i o u s l y c o n s t r a i n e d d u e t o t h e m a g n i t u d e o f t h e p r o b l e m a n d t he inherent huge costs of adaptation, addressing the loss and dama ge suffered as well as building the resilience of the communities. Mr. President, Uganda firmly believes that the collective wisdom of the global community still has a chance in saving the future of our planet and the human race; but only if we have the necessary political will to act. We must spare no effort in taking bold action now as indicated by scientific evidence in the latest Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change fifth Assessment Report. All of us must therefore demonstrate leadership based on the pr inciple of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respe ctive capabilities. There is no longer any doubt about this threat an d consequently we have no choice but to ensure that we walk the t alk and save the world from these threats. Uganda will always stand hig h to be 5 counted in supporting efforts to address this greatest challeng e of our time. Mr President, Let me now emphasize some specific issues that Lima must delive r. These include inter alia: 1. A single decision on the 2015 Agreement covering all concrete elements of the negotiating text and on the scope of the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). 2. Decision on the pre‐2020 early climate actions to close the amb ition gap and spur sustainable develop ment benefits particularly for African countries and the Least Developed Countries. In this regard, my delegation urges developed country partners to support massive investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, afforestati on as part of enhancing our national efforts to move to at least 50% use of renewable energy by the year 2040 and thereby contribute to mitigation efforts. 3. We also need to streamline public health dimension in climate c hange adaptation and mitigation policies and strategies. 4. Decision re-affirming the predictable, adequate and scaled-up climate financing as well as full operatiiona lization of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) with windows for LDCs to a ddress priority adaptation needs and Loss and Damage. We welcome the re cent pledges made by a number of 6 Developed Country partners toward s the GCF, we strongly call for capitalization of GCF to at least US D 15 billion which should be further scaled up to at leas t 40 billion by December 2015. We note with appreciation that the GCF is on track to mobilize more th an US$10 billion that will be channelled to priority actions in developing countries in the short run and therefore ready to oper ate. We further call for increased mobilization of resources towards th e existing mechanisms of the Least Development Countries Fund, Adaptation Fund and Special Climate Change Fund. We support the anchorin g of these existi ng mechanisms in the new agreement. 5. On REDD+, my delegation calls for concrete decision on full operationalization of the Warsaw REDD+ decisions and therefore paying developing countries for the efforts in conserving their forests. 6. On technology transfer and capacity building, we re-affirm our strong call for a decision to enhance scaled up technology transfer and diffusion in the most vulnerable countries. In this rega rd, my delegation wi shes to thank the UN Secretary General for his recent appointment of High Level Panel on the proposed Technology Transfer Fac ility for the LDCs and Small Island Developing States that are most vulne rable to adverse impacts of climate change. Uganda strongly believes that the time is now for the establishment of a framework under the Convention and a dedicated institution solely to 7 coordinate, monitor, evaluate and re port on capacity building under the Convention. Mr President, I w o u l d l i k e t o c o n c l u d e b y u r g i n g a l l p a r t i e s t o s h o w f l e x i b i l ity in reaching agreements to make this conference a concrete landmark towards Paris 2015. We need to ac t on increasing our mitigation ambitions, to create effective st rategies for adaptation and to apply new protections for those who are already affected and who will be affected in the future. The time to do all that is now ‐ for tomorrow will be too late. I thank you for your attention.
