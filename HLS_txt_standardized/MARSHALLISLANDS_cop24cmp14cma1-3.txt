BOX 2 Majuro, Marshall Islands 96960 ________________________________________________________________________________________________ REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS THE HONORABLE MINISTER DAVID PAUL HIGH LEVEL SEGMENT STATEMENT  Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, Madam Executive Secretary, your Excellencies,  Iakwe, and warm regards from the people of the Marshall Islands.  Excellencies, the IPCC Special Report into 1.5 degrees Celsius was a shocking wake up call to all of us. We all need to increase climate action and do so quickly. Business as usual is simply not enough. And what the Special Report makes clear is that no country will be immune from the severe consequences if we overshoot the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit of the Paris Agreement. We have seen the truth of that this year, with unprecedented climate related events in all regions of the globe. In rich countries as well as the least developed.  As you know, the Marshall Islands has been a tireless advocate for increased climate ambition, including through the High Ambition Coalition, and now also as Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum.  But beyond advocacy, we are also committed to taking real action. In September we published our long-term strategy to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as well as to achieve climate resilience. We are only one of ten countries to have done so, and the first island nation.  Last month the Marshall Islands submitted a new and more ambitious climate target to the UNFCCC – the first country in the world to do so. We also held the world’s first virtual climate Summit with the Climate Vulnerable Forum and delivered the Jumemmej Declaration calling for higher ambition.  And this week we launched our Electricity Roadmap – a key policy that will take us further down the path to net zero emissions by 2050.

At the same time the IPCC Special Report makes it clear that even if we succeed in keeping global temperature rise within the 1.5 degrees limit, we will face severe impacts.  So next year we will work towards completing our National Adaptation Plan. As a low lying atoll nation we face unique challenges which will need unique solutions. Significant international climate finance will be critical for us to put in place the adaptation responses needed to ensure that my grandchildren can live and prosper in the country I was born in. There is a clear moral obligation for countries who caused the problems we are facing to help us.  To set us on the right path, COP24 needs to set out – in a COP Decision - the next steps to raise ambition in light of the findings of the IPCC Special Report and the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue.  A full set of guidelines to implement the Paris Agreement must also be adopted here in Katowice.  I wish to convey the support of RMI to ROC, Taiwan within the international and UN specialized agencies and mechanisms, including the UNFCCC. The RMI Government places a high importance to the issue of climate change and staunchly believes that the international community, especially countries most vulnerable, cannot afford to have any missing links in the crucial task of tackling adverse impacts caused by climate change. Unfortunately, Taiwan’s exclusion from the UNFCCC is a missing link in the global efforts to combat drastic weather events and rising sea levels that have been affecting low-lying, densely populated atolls like the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  RMI recognizes ROC (Taiwan)’s achievements of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) as well as passing the Greenhouse Reduction and Management Act. Furthermore, RMI strongly supports ROC’s efforts that are in line with RMI Government’s continued efforts and prominent achievements in fighting climate change, especially its “Lighthouse Initiative,” as the core of RMI’s 2050 Climate Strategy recently launched at the UNGA Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) event.  Finally, we support calls to establish a Human Rights Focal Point in the UNFCCC. It is vital that this important area of work is taken forward. Kommol tata, thank you very much.
