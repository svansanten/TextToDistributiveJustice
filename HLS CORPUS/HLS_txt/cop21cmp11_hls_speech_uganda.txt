Mr. President,
Uganda joins the rest of the world in expressing our sympathy for the terrorist attack that killed innocent people here in Paris.
Mr. President,
From the outset, let me express my gratitude to the Government and people of France for hosting this important Conference. We also thank Peru for hosting the previous Conference which set a firm basis for deliberations at this Summit.
Mr. President,
This Conference is important and timely for addressing climate change - one of the contemporary arch challenges threatening the survival of humanity and mother earth.
For Uganda, climate change has contributed to severe weather conditions including droughts, floods, landslides, soil erosion, melting of ice caps,
famine and diseases all of which have negatively impacted the livelihoods of our people.
It is, therefore, important for this Conference to arrive at a legally-binding agreement on climate change to be implemented on the basis of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities.
Mr. President,
We call upon developed countries to demonstrate the necessary political will to ensure that critical issues under the Durban mandate such as mitigation; adaptation; loss and damage; means of implementation especially scaled-up financing, technology development and transfer; capacity building; transparency of action and support are addressed in the agreement in a comprehensive and balanced manner.
In this regard, there is need for developed countries to make firm commitments and adequate support to the Green Climate Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, as well as the Adaptation Fund to address the special needs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries Uganda inclusive.
Mr. President,
Pursuant to the provisions of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on differentiation of Parties, we urge developed countries to make firm commitments on deep reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to curtail the global temperature raise to below 1.5 degrees Centigrade. On intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), Uganda is happy to be among those countries that have submitted their INDCs
It is our hope that the agreement under consideration will provide for measurable, veriviable and periodic update of contributions under an established international transparent and compliant framework.
Mr President.
To conclude, Ugandans look to this Conference for a positive outcome because a of its significance to our survival. Uganda has contributed barely to global warming and yet continues to bear disproportionate brunt of its climate change effects. We must work together, in the spirit of genuine partnership, to decisively and effectively address these effects for the sake of the survival of humanity and saving the planet.
Mr. President
I thank you for your attention.
