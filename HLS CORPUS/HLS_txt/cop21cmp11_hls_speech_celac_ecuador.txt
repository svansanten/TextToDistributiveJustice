Mr. President,

On behalf of the Government of Ecuador, in its capacity as President Pro
Tempore of the Community of Latin American — CELAC-, I have the honor to
present this statement representing the 33 countries that integrate the
Community of CELAC, while reaffirming the objective to strengthen it as
aforum for dialogue and political agreement on issues of international and
regional agenda, including climate change.

In this regard, at the "Ill Summit of CELAC", the Heads of State and
Government of the region adopted several mandates on climate change,
including a Special Declaration (6) on this matter and other specific mandates
with a view to conform a regional position in this matter, particularly in view of
the COP21 in Paris.

Accordingly, I have the honor to inform this plenary, that after several months
of meetings and thanks to the constructive participation of all Member
States, it has been possible to identify the following common elements
towards COP21, which do reflect national priorities and
circumstances towards COP 21, while respecting their respective negotiating
positions.

The full text of common elements will be delivered to the Secretariat for its
diffusion and distribution, regardless of which, I will emphasize the substantial
principal elements agreed at the level of CELAC.

Mr. President,

The member countries of CELAC recognize climate change as a persistent
crisis, which also represents one of the major world problems and
compromises our capacities to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable
development, as a result of the negative effects of extreme meteorological
phenomena and slow-onset events due to climate change, such as
hurricanes, floods, desertification, droughts, receding glaciers, sea level
rising, coastal erosion, ocean acidification and the phenomena of "El Niño"
and "La Niña", among others, that threaten the rich biodiversity and natural
resources upon which many of our economies depend and further threaten food
security as well as the survival of our population in harmony with nature.

We emphasize the need for an effective, appropriate and fair international
response to this global problem through the elaboration of a protocol, another
legal instrument or an agreed conclusion with legal force, under the UNFCCC,
that is legally binding and applicable to all Parties, to achieve its objective as
set in its article 2,to allow an adequate adaptation and to hold the increase in
global average temperature below 1.5°-2° degrees Celsius relative to pre-
industrial levels, through the full implementation of the principles and
provisions of the Convention, including in particular the principle of common
but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity. We
agree that differentiation should be applied to all elements of the agreement,
with a practical sense for its adequate implementation in each case
accordingly.

We reaffirm that the agreement to be adopted at the COP21, should address
urgently the needs and special circumstances derived from the particular
vulnerabilities of all our countries facing climate change, including particularly
the Small Island Developing States — SIDS, as well as the countries of the
central-american isthmus and the countries that suffer the effects of “El Niño”
and “La Niña” phenomena, recognizing the urgent needs and the special
circumstances of developing countries, and taking into account the
recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Mr. President,

We further reaffirm that the results of COP21 should take into account the
adverse impacts of climate change on social groups such as the poorest
communities of our societies, indigenous peoples, migrants, persons with
disabilities, women, children and the elderly.

We affirm that adaptation is a priority for all the region, and in that sense we
demand that it is addressed in an urgent and balanced manner and with
political parity with regard to mitigation, recognizing the efforts of our countries
to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and strengthening the
provision of finance, technology transfer and capacity building to increase our
adaptation actions. In that sense, we support a balance in financing for
adaptation and mitigation over time and we highlight the importance of the
continuity of the Adaptation Fund beyond 2020.

We demand that the issue of loss and damage is included in the Paris
Agreement, in line with the principle of common but differentiated
responsibilities and respective capabilities, without prejudice to the current
work of the International Warsaw Mechanism of Loss and Damage and
ensuring that this mechanism and other relevant institutions which may
developed under the Convention, have permanence in time to address loss
and damage associated with climate change and the needs of developing
countries in our region.

We emphasize that the ambitious voluntary mitigation and adaptation actions
of our countries must be recognized as a contribution to the global effort. We
affirm our determination to maintain and enhance these actions and policies
to mitigate and adapt to climate change, including through the continuous and
enhanced provision by developed countries of necessary means of implementation, 
in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated
responsibilities and respective capabilities.

We urge the developed countries to lead the reduction of emissions through
targets that are ambitious, absolute and €conomy-wide and in line with the
long-term temperature goal of 1.5 — 2 degree Celsius relative to pre-industrial
levels; and we recognize the importance for developing countries to expand over 
time their mitigations and adaptation actions in the context of sustainable
development and with the appropriate support. In that framework, we urge 
developed countries to fulfill their commitments of providing finance support,
technology transfer and development and capacity buillding for developing 
countries in the pre-2020 and post-2020 period, recognizing that the ambition
of many developing countries in the fight against climate change may 
increase with the fulfillment of these commitments.

We emphasize the importance that the provision of financial resources from
developed to developing countries must be additional, pedictable, accessible
to all dveloping countries, approriate and increased progressively based on
the 100 billion dollars per year from 2020 in accordance with the needs and 
priorities identified by developing countries, with a view to fulfilling the
objective of the convention through a roadmap that identifies the expected
annual levels of resources and a regular replenishment process to the 
Green Climate Fund including rulees of monitoring, reporting and verification
of funds effectively provided. We express our conviction that the Green 
Climate Fund and the other operative entities and funds established under
the Finance Mechanism and Kyoto Protocol, must play a key role in the 
climate financing under the convention. 

We recognize the need to undertake fundamental changes in the way our
societies produce and consume goods and services through a change in the
consumption and production pattern at global level, led by developed
countries as a fundamental element of the climate action and the promotion of
economic and social development in harmony with nature, taking into account
the capacity of developing countires, while reaffirming the policy space of
our countries and the existence of different views, approaches and models
to achieve the sustainable development.

We call all countries to recognize the crucial importance of education,
capacity building, public awareness, participation and access to information,
the promotion and the protection of all human rights without discrimination,
including the rights of workers, the intergenerational approach, equity and the
integration of the different visions of Society, indigenous peoples and local
communities and farmers, giving special consideration to gender equality and
empowerment of women and youth, to promote changes in lifestyles, attitudes
and behaviors needed to foster sustainable development and poverty
eradication of our region.

We recognize the need to support and strengthen the knowledge, Practices
and technologies of indigenous peoples and local communities including
those related to adaptation and mitigation of climate change in a holistic and
integrated manner.

Likewise, we commit ourselves to strengthening policies, programs and
projects undertaken by our countries on the protection, conservation,
restoration and comprehensive management of our various ecosystems and
their co-benefits to address climate change and to achieve sustainable
development and, we encourage a greater international recognition and
support for this purpose. 

Mr. President,

The Paris Agreement and the decision adopted for its implementation, should
consider the importance of food security, as well as of adaptation to the
adverse effects of climate change, in the manner that production and
distribution of food, agriculture, livestock and fisheries are not threatened, and
taking into account the particularities of food production that not always have
available technology for absolute emission reduction. At the same time, the
Paris Agreement and the decisions adopted for its implementation must not
generate barriers to international trade.

We identify the need to strengthen the resilience of oceans and seas to the
impacts of climate change, including the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity in the face of a post-2020 scenario, in line with article 4.1 (d) of
the Convention.

We urge the international community, and especially the developed countries,
to fulfill all their commitments under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol,
and the urgent ratification of the Doha Amendment so as to allow the entry
into force of the second commitment period as soon as possible.

We stress the importance of promoting the development of technology, its
transfer, dissemination and diffusion to developing countries on favorable
terms, including on concessional and preferential terms.

In conclusion Mr. President,

We recognize the leadership and the efforts made by Peru, a member of our
region, during its presidency of the COP20, and we hope that this COP21 can
conclude in a successful manner where Ecuador and all the member
countries of CELAC will involve our commitment and constructive support.

I thank you.
