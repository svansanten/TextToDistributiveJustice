Chair, 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
On behalf of the Government of Viet Nam, I would like to express our 
appreciation to the Kingdom of Morocco for organiz ing this important 
Conference. 
Chair, 
As the Paris Agreement enter ed into force on 4th November 2016 , it is 
imperative for all Parties to implement their commitments under the Agreement . 
To that end , Viet Nam would like to propose as follows : 
First, specific actions for advancing our post -2020 commitments must be 
further defined by Parties under the entire context of the Paris Agreement to 
enhance the implementation of the Convention . All elements of the Agreement, 
inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer 
and capacity building must be only addressed in a balanced manner . 
Second, national determination in nationally determined contributions 
(NDCs) must be respected by providing further guidance and means of 
implementations , with due attention to the differentiated responsibilities of 
Parties, taking into account special circumstances and capabilities of developing 
countries. 
Third, we needs to strike a b alance between pre and post -2020 actions in 
order not to create gaps i n global efforts to combat climate change.  
Chair, 
Fully aware of the importance of implementation of the Paris Agreement at 
the national level, Viet Nam has formulated an action plan specifying 
contributions to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate chang e. This includes 
emission reduction of 8% compared to the BAU scenario . The reduction ambition 
can be raised up to 25% upon reception of adequate support from the international 
community . 
Allow me to conclude by saying that Viet Nam will make every effort to 
work together with the international community in ensuring an effective 
implementation of the Paris Agreement. 
Only through concerted efforts could we succeed in saving our Earth. 
I thank you.
