Mr. President, Excellencies, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentleman,
I wish to extend Micronesia’s sympathies to the people and the government of the Philippines for the loss of lives and property caused by Typhoon Hagupit.
My delegation thanks the government and the people of Peru for their warm hospitality. I associate my statement with the statement made by Nauru on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. I commend all the Parties for their hard work and the forward progress made so far at COP20. However, at this COP, as at others before, I feel that the pace and progress of these negotiations fails to meet the exigency of the climate crisis and to keep us on track to meet agreed goals.
They also fail to correspond what the science suggests is necessary, particularly as captured in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, which highlights that human activity is clearly impacting our climate, leading to sea-level rise and linked to extreme weather events, among other dangerous threats to lives and livelihoods in my country and worldwide.
These impacts and emerging threats consistently undermine our sustainable development efforts and threaten not only our people’s livelihoods, but also our territorial integrity and our sovereignty. Adaptation measures are already necessary, but they will not be sufficient.

In the end, small island States will not be able to stop global climate change through our domestic actions alone. The major polluters, especially those who are most responsible for climate change, have the moral obligation to do much more, to take the lead and to raise their ambition now. If major emitters do this, then we still have the potential to significantly narrow the pre-2020 ambition gap under Workstream 2 of the Durban Platform.
Mr. President,
As we come to the end of the International Year of the SIDS, we hope to leave Lima on a high note.
Pledges to the Green Climate Fund have now passed the $10 billion threshold, which could mark a significant step forward, but these pledges must be fulfilled without delay and they must be accessible to SIDS.
Other potentially encouraging news is the progress toward a decision on the initial two-year work plan for the Warsaw Mechanism on Loss and Damage. We call on our partners to deliver the large scale financing that it will take to support a credible mechanism. Loss and damage should also be included as an element in the new agreement.
An ambitious and legally-binding climate change treaty in Paris is still possible. We support an initial commitment period of five years under this agreement.
We also fully support inclusion of gender equality in the text of the new agreement. Full and equal participation of women in all climate actions and decision making processes should be a guiding principle for all.
Mr. President,
Not only can we still attain an ambitious agreement, but we can also prevent some of the worst impacts of climate change in the near term, but only if we take fast and ambitious actions now, such as using the Montreal Protocol to reduce the powerful greenhouse gases HFCs.
Deep and immediate cuts in carbon dioxide emissions are paramount for long-term climate stabilization, but HFC emissions are hundreds to thousands more times powerful than CO2, and HFCs are the fastest growing greenhouse gases in many countries.
For this reason, six years ago, Micronesia introduced a proposal to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase down the consumption and production of HFCs. We were guided by scientific and technical studies, and we were inspired by our prior experiences within the Montreal Protocol and our trust in its institutional and financial expertise.
In the years since then, phasing down HFCs using the expertise and institutions of the Montreal Protocol has gained near-universal support. Both the 2012 Rio+20 outcome document and the 2014 Samoa Pathway call for the phase down of the production and consumption of HFCs, and the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have decided to convene two HFC Management Workshops, the second of which will be held in Bangkok in April 2015.

By agreeing to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol next year, we could nearly eliminate one of the primary greenhouse gases and create critical momentum toward a successful outcome in Paris. We must all take every opportunity to cooperate in every forum throughout 2015 and not reserve our ambitious actions and announcements for COP21 itself. COP21 starts now.
Mr. President,
As a final note, the UN Secretary-General shared with us the importance of the Paris agreement as one of the milestones in the post-2015 development process. We also note his plan for a high-level summit on climate change in June. The sustainable development discussions are complementary and reinforcing, and can only help pave a smooth road to Paris.
Thank you.
