Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Let me thank the United Arab Emirates for hosting this critical conference . 
Climate change is one of the biggest global challenges of our time. Risks linked to it affect 
everyone . But some regions face higher dangers than others. 
Our partners across the world deal with serious challenges . From extreme weather to 
lack of water , which I saw during my visit to Africa last month. 
This is why we support the UN Secretary -General’s “Early Warnings for All” . It is a bold 
vision . It says that everyone should be protected from weather, water, or climate 
hazards by 2027. 
By the same year, Czechia is ready to give 4 million US dollars for the activities of the 
Green Climate Fund. It will help developing countries to face climate change and adapt 
to its impacts.  
My country supports the Paris Agreement and the EU climate and energy goals . 
Including the goal of carbon neutral economy by 2050. 
We are taking steps to stop coal for electricity and heating by 2033. In part , this can be 
achieved by renovating buildings and developing renewable energy sources. 
But I want to be clear , that the success of our wider climate goals is fundamentally 
dependent on nuclear energy. 
This is a good thing. Nuclear power is both reliable and clean . So we should use its 
benefits. One way is the development of a new generation of modular reactors. 
A global nuclear renaissance can be an effective solution for our challenges. 
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, there are many links between the environment, 
sustainable living conditions and the global peace. We cannot have one without another. 
We should keep that in mind , when we try to solve global problems . And when we help 
people out of poverty and adapt to climate change. 
As a top priority, we must always collaborate internationally. And we must innovate and 
research for better life for future generations . Thank you.
