• WE START BY CONGRATULATING YOUR EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT SISI FOR SUCCESSFULLY CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT SUMMIT IN THIS BEAUTIFUL TOURIST RESORT OF SHARM EL SHEIKH.
• THANK YOU MOST SINCERELY FOR YOUR WARM HOSPITALITY AND THAT OF THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT.

MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES;
• WITH THE AFRICAN CONTINENT BEING MOST ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, AND WITH COP-27 TAKING PLACE HERE IN AFRICA, IT GIVES US HIGH EXPECTATIONS THAT “THE AFRICAN, YET GLOBAL, COP” WILL DELIVER SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AND IMPLEMENTABLE CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS ON THE PRIORITY LIST FOR AFRICA AND OTHER LDCs.
• WE EXPECT THIS CONFERENCE TO RECOGNIZE “AFRICA’S AND OTHER LDCs’ SPECIAL NEEDS AND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES”, GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR CONTINENT AND OUR PEOPLE, MEASURED AGAINST AFRICA’S LOW CONTRIBUTION OF 4% TOWARDS THE GLOBAL EMISSIONS PROBLEM, YET WE ARE IMPACTED NEGATIVELY THE MOST.
MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES;
• OUR GOVERNMENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED MARKED COMMITMENT TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE IN LINE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT.
• HOWEVER, IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE OUR CONTRIBUTION TO ADDRESSING THIS GLOBAL THREAT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SAFEGUARDING OUR PEOPLE’S LIVES AND LIVELIOOHDS, WE NEED STRONG AND ENDURING INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND SUPPORT WHICH DELIVER ON ITS COMMITMENTS.
• AS CHAIR OF THE AFRICAN GROUP OF NEGOTIATORS, ZAMBIA HAS SUBMITTED AN AMBITIOUS REVISED AND UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION AS REQUIRED BY THE PARIS AGREEMENT.
MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES;
• CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION REMAINS A TOP PRIORITY FOR ZAMBIA AND WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON ACTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE RESILIENCE OF OUR POPULATION, ECOSYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE, PRODUCTIVE AND HEALTH SYSTEMS.
• THEREFORE, WE HOPE THAT COP-27 WILL DELIVER A MILESTONE OUTCOME IN ADVANCING THE WORK PROGRAMME ON THE GLOBAL GOAL ON ADAPTATION THAT WE ADOPTED AT COP-26 IN 2021.
MR PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES;
• WHILE WE CONTINUE TO URGE FOR THE WORLD TO INCREASE ITS AMBITION AND COMMITMENT TOWARDS CLIMATE CHANGE, ZAMBIA WILL NOT SIT IDLY AND WAIT FOR THE WORLD TO LIVE UP TO ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.
• WE HAVE IDENTIFIED MITIGATION ACTIONS AS A MEANS OF ATTAINMENT OF OUR ASPIRATIONS, WHILE ADVANCING INVESTMENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF CREATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF LIVELIHOODS, JOBS AND REDUCING POVERTY.
• WE ARE FORMULATING A GREEN GROWTH STRATEGY WHICH WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR TRANSITIONING THE COUNTRY INTO A CLIMATE SMART GREEN ECONOMY.
• WE ARE PROMOTING DIVERSIFICATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES IN ORDER TO EXPAND OUR ENERGY MIX AND REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOT-PRINT WHILE PROMOTING VALUE ADDITION TO ADDRESS OUR SOCIO-ECONOMIC NEEDS.
MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES;
• AS WE CONCLUDE, WE WISH TO APPEAL TO OUR ESTEEMED PARTNERS TO FULFILL THEIR PLEDGE OF THE US$100 BILLION PER YEAR FOR US TO MEET OUR INTENDED GOALS. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOTIVATION FOR US ALL TO CONTINUE WITH OUR EFFORTS IN ADDITION TO BEING A GOOD MEASURE OF CREDIBILITY.
• WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AND A NOBLE TASK TO DELIVER FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS, FOR OUR PLANET, ESPECIALLY THAT WE ARE MEETING HERE ON OUR CONTINENT THAT IS MOST IN NEED.
• FELLOW DELEGATES AND COLLEAGUES, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE CAN CHOOSE TO DO OR NOT TO DO CERTAIN THINGS. IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE NO CHOICE TO EXERCISE, WE SIMPLY HAVE TO ACT NOW AND ACT POSITIVELY.
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION.
